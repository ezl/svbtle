<p>Traders make more money than I do now. I guess $0 a year is an easy bar to beat.</p>

<div>

Traders like making money. But (broad generalization) while traders like the money, they&#8217;re driven less by money itself than the status and the challenge of creating money.  And this is where today&#8217;s story goes &#8211; Startups are hot. Traders see Facebook, LinkedIn, Groupon, AngiesList, Yelp IPOs and can&#8217;t help but think: &#8220;easy edge&#8221;. And they have the excess capital to fund their pursuits.

<strong>Shameless Self Plug</strong>

[caption id=&#8221;attachment_29&#8221; align=&#8221;alignright&#8221; width=&#8221;215&#8221; caption=&#8221;Online Apartment Applications&#8221;]<a href="http://rocketlease.com"><img class="size-full wp-image-29" title="Rocket Lease" src="http://ezliu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/logo2.png" alt="" width="215" height="60" /></a>[/caption]

My little startup, <strong>Rocket Lease</strong>, provides <a href="http://rocketlease.com">online apartment applications and credit checks</a>. It&#8217;s decidedly unsexy. It&#8217;s a tiny bit of the process that helps landlords take applicants and turn them into tenants. It&#8217;s small. I don&#8217;t really know how much money it is going to make, or what the right monetization strategy is, but I&#8217;ll almost certainly charge a small amount on every credit check I run.  So Rocket Lease is going to grind its way to profitability, a couple bucks at a time.  Buy credit checks wholesale, sell them retail. Rocket Lease is 7-11 for credit scores. Yeah, girls swoon upon hearing that.

So my old colleagues often say &#8220;hey ezl, why don&#8217;t you build something like Facebook/Twitter/LinkedIn? The payout is WAAAAY bigger&#8221;. <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3691090">Other smart people</a> have written along these lines too.

Here&#8217;s why.  I&#8217;m not prepared to pay the buy in to play the big startup game.

<strong>Darts</strong>

I play darts (I&#8217;m lying, I don&#8217;t really).

<img class="aligncenter" title="Dartboard" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Darts_in_a_dartboard.jpg/283px-Darts_in_a_dartboard.jpg" alt="" width="283" height="188" />

Big startups are a dartboard with a bullseye worth $300mm.  Then sprinkled around the board there are a couple of smaller value sections, $50k, $100k, but the majority of the board is a wasteland of big fat $0 sections.

Small startups are a dartboard where the bullseye might be worth $2mm. and if you miss by a little, it&#8217;s worth $1mm. The rest of the board is comprised of sections that range from $0 to $100k, and while there are $0 sections, the majority of the sections are values greater than $0.  They might not be big numbers, but they&#8217;re non-zero numbers.

The expected value of a random point on the big startup dartboard is $2m (small chance at a lot of money, big chance at nothing). The small startup expected value is $250k (small chance at 2mm, lots of small chances at other payouts). Great. &#8220;small expected value, small variance&#8221; VS. &#8220;big expected value, big variance&#8221;.

Now here&#8217;s the kicker. To play the game, <strong>you have to buy the dartboard</strong>. Price tag?
<ul>
    <li>Big startup dartboard: 2 years of life and $100k in cash.</li>
    <li>Small startup dartboard: 6 months of life and $25k in cash.</li>
</ul>
Where are you now? There&#8217;s no right answer to this. If you&#8217;re 30 and broke and wondering how you&#8217;re going to pay the rent in 6 months, its harder to swing for the fences.  If you sold your last startup so you&#8217;ll never have to worry about food and rent again, big startup board.

<strong>Rocket Lease</strong> is me saying that 40k a year would be life changing for me; and while 200k a year would be better than 40k a year, its not better enough  to warrant the higher buy in and increased probability of getting nothing.
