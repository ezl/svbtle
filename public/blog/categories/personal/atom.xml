    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It's Christmas Eve, on a beautiful, sunny, 75 degree afternoon in Texas.</p>

<p>My sister is baking in the kitchen, my dad is workin on some hobby projects
around the house, and my mom is also here milling about the house.  I'm at the
kitchen table, taking a break from hacking on a little side project I started
with a new friend, AG.</p>

<p>Sunny and 75 degrees has a way of making it not feel quite like the Christmas
stories we're watching on the TV that's playing in our background, but really,
this is what I like about Christmas -- spending time in the company of family
and friends, with everyone doing what makes them happy.</p>

<h2>Hacking Is Nerd Fun</h2>

<p>I like hacking. My family thinks its work, and most of my friends
do too.  But it's not.</p>

<p>Hacking is building. It's a hobby. Code is just the medium of digital
craftsmen. It's 2012's version of building a shelf in the
workshop, tinkering with that project car in the garage, baking to relieve
stress, etc.  It's just a electronic version.  It's no more antisocial
to stare at a screen than a table saw or under the hood of that old muscle
car. In fact, I get to talk to my family while I hack. It's fun.</p>

<p>If you're a nerd, code an endless supply of puzzles to solve. Nobody will call
you a workaholic for working on a puzzle in your living room, but since
most people use computers against their will at work to create TPS reports,
they don't get that this is nerd fun.</p>

<p>I'm not working on anything related to my "job" (<a href="http://www.rocketlease.com/">Rocket Lease, online rental applications</a>),
but I'm using all the same tools. It's fun. I've timeboxed a few days off for
building an MVP so its pretty much stress-free creation.</p>

<p>I'm hacking on Xmas eve, its not work, and I'm loving it.  I'm not sure how
to explain to others that this is fun for me, and I'm not sure if I have to.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was chatting to a friend about doomsday predictions for 12/21/2012 and wondered what I'd do if I thought that there was some credibility to the Mayan doomsday prophecy.</p>

<p><img src="/images/mayan_doomsday.png" alt="Mayan Doomsday" /></p>

<p>What if we could validate with certainty that there is a 75% chance that the world as we know it will end in 2 weeks.  As a thought experiment, imagine we have a credible threat against planet earth by an alien race.</p>

<p>These aliens have stated that they are going to roll a 4 sided die, and if the outcome is 4, they'll be our guardian protectors forever, but if the outcome is 1, 2, or 3 they will annihilate our planet.  This is unstoppable by us.  We believe the threat to be real because they have demonstrated their power by speaking to us and broadcasting the message to the entire planet from light years away (so they're too far away for us to even reach them, given our existing technology) and demonstrated their far superior technology.</p>

<p>Anyways, the point is: there is a 75% chance the world will end. There is a 25% chance it won't. What do you do with your next 2 weeks?</p>

<p>If you rape and pillage and spend all your money, then there's a 25% chance you'll be in trouble when they don't destroy our planet and life goes back to normal.</p>

<p>If you just go on living life, you'd be missing out on the opportunity to proclaim your love to your crush or blow your 401k on the lifestyle you could never have.</p>

<p>What would you do? How does that change if the odds of doomsday are increased to 90% or decreased to 10%?</p>

<p>I was looking up crossfit related pictures yesterday. I love this picture and it's my blog so I get to do whatever I want. Booyah.</p>

    <link href="http://www.ezliu.com//blog/founder-failure-insurance-follow-up/"/>
    <updated>2012-09-27T17:31:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.ezliu.com//blog/founder-failure-insurance-follow-up</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I got a few interested queries when I wrote first about <a href="/blog/founder-equity-pool/">Founder Failure Insurance</a> and I've thought about it a bit more since then.</p>

<p>Today I received a short and sweet email from TV:</p>

<blockquote><p>Interesting premise.  Not saying I would contribute but would love to hear more about it.</p></blockquote>

<p>Naturally, I thought it would be sensible to ramble endlessly in response. Here's what I wrote:</p>

<blockquote><p>'Twas really mostly an idea at a bar amongst friends.</p>

<p>I think there's a lot of sense in it, its essentially portfolio diversification.  As a single founder you're just investing 100% in your own stock and nobody else's.  You're constrained to one industry, one vertical, and one implementation.  You are basically ALL variance.</p>

<p>Ideally, as a founder, you should feel like you're working on the best stock, so in a sense, trading any of your company for other companies might be a negative expected value play -- however, by picking partner/portfolio companies effectively you decrease your return variance. Pick your poison.</p>

<p>Realistically, even though you should think your idea is the best, you should also hopefully accept that your idea <em>might not</em> be the best, the highest EV, or the most likely to succeed.  Then a founder's insurance fund makes total sense.</p>

<p>Of course, you can't just throw equity willy nilly into a pool of losers equity.  In the ideal case for any individual founder, they are the dog of the pool.  You want to put 5% into a pool with the next Stripe, Airbnb, Heroku, and Dropbox.  Of course, they want the same.  So you'll have to find a situation where you're equally yoked.  You need to have something they want, and they need to have something you want.</p>

<p>There are a couple of obvious flavors of this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Industry diversification:</strong> I'm in real estate. I think mobile is hot. Someone else is doing a more stable consumer play.  An enterprise person. Different profiles of returns with different difficulties, but essentially betting on other founders to rock it in their field.  Each founders is effectively investing into a hand chosen seed fund thats trying to hedge its bets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Industry saturation:</strong> Well shit, There will definitely be an open table competitor that crushes open table.  There are probably 50 companies that are trying. Three person shops that have decent idea but might not make it. One, or a few of these companies will make a run at it, maybe merge, and emerge victorious.  You all have a shot.  Equity in a pool early on ensures that (a) you guys are incentivized to share and help each other out, improving all of your odds, (b) if your company isn't the winner, you still get to participate on the rewards.  Basically, you know you picked the right sector, but how do you know if you've picked the right name? This lets you eliminate the idiosyncratic risk (in the extreme where ALL the viable startups in a space are pooled).</p></li>
</ol>


<p>In practice, you'll end up finding like minded people. If you get in a group of founders thats too good for you, they won't want your equity. If you're too good for them, you won't want their equity.  Everyone wants to imagine that they're the best founder.  You'll probably just have to be different enough that your the best in at least one dimension that makes you desirable to the others.</p>

<p>I've had a few interesting conversations with founders.  The biggest hurdle to this right now is distribution.  If we were to find 10 founders that were interested, that wouldn't be enough because we'd need to subclass that group into equally good/likely/viable startups/founders.  We need 100s of founders to jump into a dating pool and select each other.</p></blockquote>

<p>If you think there's anything interesting about this idea, the best thing you can do is help me spread it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you're working on a startup or freelancing, you often find yourself frequenting cafes around town. If you're like me, you try to stay away from Starbucks.</p>

<p>I've compiled a list of personal favorites and recommendations from other startup friends, grouped by approximate geographic location.</p>

<p>If you're funemployed like me, have other great spots I can add to the list, or want to join the Chicago Daytime Coffeeshop Circuit, or "CDCC" as I like to call it (yep, I just made that up), drop a line: <a href="mailto:ezl@rocketlease.com">ipoopdaily@rocketlease.com</a></p>
