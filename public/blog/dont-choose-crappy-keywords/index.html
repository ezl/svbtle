	<div class="entry-content"><p>In my first experiments, I found that <a href="http://ezliu.com/currently-paying-150-per-conversion/">Adwords conversions were costing me almost $150 per conversion</a>. No big surprise, within 10 minutes of looking at the resulting data, I found that I had been bidding for some terrible keywords.</p>

<blockquote>For example:

&#8221;<strong>basic rental agreement</strong>&#8221; &#8211; this sounds like it might be  pretty good, which is why I threw it in the pool, but the conversion rate was far below the average and it generated lots of clicks (ouch).

It&#8217;s deceptively promising sounding, but that particular phrase is missing the point of Rocket Lease.  Rocket Lease does the rental *application*; People searching for a &#8220;rental agreement&#8221; are beyond qualifying tenants and are looking for a standard lease. They don&#8217;t need what I have to offer. Paying for them to visit my site is basically a donation to Google.  The Adwords data confirms this with a 0%  conversion rate for 450 clicks of that phrase. *</blockquote>


<p>Further digging revealed that I was actually bidding for a lot of keywords that contain the phrase &#8220;rental agreement&#8221; &#8211; These, as a a group accounted for a lot of clicks, but a very low conversion rate, and costed me<strong> $464.00 per conversion</strong>, or 3x my average conversion rate.</p>

<p>Just excluding the keywords that include &#8220;rental agreement&#8221; would have brought my conversion cost down <strong>from $149.53 to $101.16 (a 32.9% reduction)</strong>.</p>

<p>Other terms too, like &#8220;Free eviction check&#8221;, didn&#8217;t do so hot for me, which isn&#8217;t surprising considering that&#8217;s not what Rocket Lease does. Hopefully by eliminating the garbage, I can quickly get to even cheaper conversion costs before I even do any on-site conversion optimization.</p>

<p><strong>Going Forward</strong></p>

<p>My measured conversion value is $4.63 so that still puts me pretty far away from making AdWords economics work out, but I&#8217;m still chasing this thread because:</p>

<ol>
    <li>I think my true conversion value is almost certainly higher. $4.63 was the total estimated conversion value as measured from right after the exploratory AdWords campaign stopped.
        <ul>
            <li>There&#8217;s a bit of lag between conversion and profit (landlord signs up == conversion, profit occurs when the landlord asks an applicant to fill out an application), and</li>
            <li>that number doesn&#8217;t account for return customers.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The initial keyword selection was pretty naive (as the &#8220;rental agreement&#8221; indicates)</li>
    <li>First data also includes exploratory analysis to determine what keywords we should be looking for</li>
    <li>There was a learning period to improve CPC. My friend Jake, during the duration of the initial Adwords run, optimized my campaign substantially for clicks,cutting down my CPC by more than 50% &#8211; however, the data includes the entire learning process.</li>
    <li>There has been no explicit optimization for conversion, through adwords (I think I might get better by controlling max CPC)</li>
    <li>The current site is pretty ugly, and we can probably improve signup/conversion rate on site by making the site better.</li>
</ol>


<p>I can&#8217;t prove this yet, but I would be surprised if my real customer LTV wasn&#8217;t north of $25, and I feel pretty confident that by being smarter about keyword selection, doing a little bit to optimize conversion costs in Adwords, and beautifying the home page, I could probably get the conversion cost below $50.00/conversion.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s still not a win, obviously, but if I&#8217;m right that inexperienced me can get within a factor of 2, I&#8217;m betting there&#8217;s a fighting chance that someone better at Adwords can push that into &#8220;money machine&#8221; territory.</p>

<address><span style="color: #999999;">* Surprisingly a high CTR though, I bet its because my domain name contains the word &#8220;Lease&#8221; in it, which probably sounds promising to visitors.</span></address>
