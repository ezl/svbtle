<p><a href="http://www.rocketlease.com"><img class=" wp-image-37   alignright" title="Easy Online Rental Applications" src="http://ezliu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/rl2.png" alt="" width="262" height="137" /></a></p>

<p>My startup, <strong>Rocket Lease</strong>, provides <a href="http://www.rocketlease.com">online apartment applications</a>. If you rent an apartment in the United States, at some point, you&#8217;ll probably fill out a paper application form to give the prospective landlord information like: your name, address, social security number, date of birth, current/previous landlords, net worth, income, etc. as a way to qualify yourself as a good tenant. Your landlord will review this and possibly run a credit check to evaluate your candidacy. This frequently still happens on paper. <a href="http://www.rocketlease.com">Rocket Lease</a> makes it happen online.</p>

<p>I tell you this not to pitch my idea to you. I tell you this to convey how small and unambitious it can sound. And to tell you this is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">deliberate strategic decision</span>.</p>

<p>Focus.</p>

<p><strong>What Rocket Lease Does NOT Do</strong></p>

<p>Now let me tell you about some of the things I DON&#8217;T do:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Help tenants find an apartment</li>
    <li>Help prospective renters choose the best neighborhoods based on nearby bars/restaurants</li>
    <li>Aggregate a list of popular buildings and put out reviews</li>
    <li>Help landlords find qualified leads</li>
    <li>Tell landlords if an applicant will be a good tenant</li>
    <li>Lease signing</li>
    <li>Lead gen for tenant services (move in, move out, maids, painting)</li>
    <li>Process rent payments</li>
    <li>Help roommates share utilities</li>
    <li>Landlord-tenant communication tools</li>
    <li>Landlord financial services (automated tax form generation)</li>
    <li>Maintenance request ticketing system (lead gen for plumbers?)</li>
</ol>


<p>I am not avoiding these because I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re good businesses. They are. By my estimate, almost every single one of these businesses is a $1 billion+ a year market. In fact, I have great friends whose individual startups are tackling some of these other businesses; I hope that some day we&#8217;ll all collaborate.</p>

<p><a title="Rocket Lease" href="http://www.rocketlease.com">Rocket Lease</a> is literally just an alternative to an existing process where information is transmitted between two parties by ink on dead-tree paper. It is an HTML form with some functional candy. But it&#8217;s all I think about and it&#8217;s going to be a damn good HTML form.</p>

<p>Focus.</p>

<p><a href="http://ezliu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/focus.jpg"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-38" title="Focus" src="http://ezliu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/focus-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">One awesome thing</span> about startups in the rental space is the abundance of free feedback. Everyone knows someone in the rental space &#8211; an uncle that manages property, your landlord, your friend who is a leasing agent, your friend who has rented a place. As a result, most people have dealt with the hassles and frustrations of renting and they volunteer a lot of great feedback.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">One awful thing</span> about startups in the rental space is &#8230; the abundance of free feedback. Everyone knows someone in the rental space&#8230; so they have a lot of great ideas about how you could make your business WAAAAY better. &#8220;The <em>real</em> pain point for leasing agents is finding apartment seekers. If Rocket Lease would only solve leasing agent lead gen, it&#8217;d be huge. If it&#8217;d only do online rent payments, it&#8217;d tap a 3 trillion dollar market.&#8221;</p>

<p>Focus.</p>

<p>Rocket Lease is as minimal a viable product as I could imagine being useful. I am a landlord. Renting my properties is a pain. There was a time when I had to fax copies of applications to a company in the suburbs of Chicago, and they would fax me back a credit check within 48 hours. This is insane.</p>

<p>The stated goal of Rocket Lease is to make this process suck a little less. The goal is not to make the entire process perfect (yet). Could I do more? You betcha. Will I ever do more? Hopefully. Can I do more now? Not a chance. I can barely keep up as it is.</p>

<p>It would be awesome if Rocket Lease did some of the other things. Sometimes they sound deceptively easy to add on (&#8220;hey you&#8217;re already in the rental space, it&#8217;s just, like&#8230; two more pages&#8230;&#8221;). Each of those deceptively simple add-on ideas has full startups dedicated exclusively to that niche. I can&#8217;t possibly compete with them while dividing my attention.</p>

<p>I love what I&#8217;m doing, and I think it has the potential to help a lot of people and grow into something huge. For that reason it&#8217;s really hard not to get excited about adjacent markets and chase tangents. Some people are good at multi-tasking and managing a bunch of different loops. I am not. For that reason precisely, if I&#8217;m to <em>ever</em> have a shot at doing those other great things, I have to ruthlessly cut them out of my scope today.</p>

<p>Focus.</p>
