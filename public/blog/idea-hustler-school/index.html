	<h1 class="title">Idea: Hustler School</h1>
	<div class="entry-content"><p>Non-technical people frequently approach me to build them an MVP. &#8221;<em>Why should
I work with you?</em>&#8221;, I ask. &#8221;<em>Because I&#8217;m a great hustler</em>&#8221;, they respond.</p>

<p>A lot of these people claim to have access to capital, connections,
tons of domain expertise, or whatever. Basically, there are a lot of great
hustlers in the making, but they don&#8217;t have a track record and can&#8217;t prove
that they are good hustlers.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to invert the typical &#8220;incubator&#8221; process. Applicants pay money,
buy into a company, get an MVP, and hustle.</p>

<p>First time hustlers, this is where I tell you to put your money where your
mouth is. Stop saying &#8220;if only i had product, i&#8217;d be an awesome hustler&#8221;</p>

<p>For $5,000, you get half of the company (an MVP), and operate as the CEO for
3 months. We will agree upon guidelines for success/failure metrics and if
you are the hustler you claim to be, you&#8217;ll win big.</p>

<p>If you fail, you&#8217;ll be forced to either recognize that you&#8217;re not the hustler
you thought you were or explain how/why you failed.</p>

<p>New hustlers <strong>wildly</strong> underestimate the amount of effort it takes to get
traction, how much unglamorous grunt work there is, and don&#8217;t have a good
idea of how to methodically test approaches to traction.  Many new hustlers
are also often attracted to the glamour of startups but are pretty lazy when
it&#8217;s not just sitting around and talking ideas.</p>

<p>The hustler&#8217;s job is to take a mutually agreed upon idea (probably an MVP of my
choosing), and get traction.</p>

<p>The hustler pays $5k, gets a functioning MVP (that he/she agrees to work on),
options for 50% of the company, then hustles:</p>

<ul>
<li>write blog posts</li>
<li>seo that sucker</li>
<li>create landing pages</li>
<li>cold call</li>
<li>pass out flyers</li>
<li>do logistics for our new food delivery service</li>
<li>do dishes</li>
<li>find an office space</li>
<li>learn about a/b testing</li>
<li>raise money</li>
</ul>


<p>or any number of hustlery things.</p>

<p>The &#8220;fund&#8221; provides guidance on these things, points hustlers in the right direction,
but the responsibility is mostly on the hustler to move the needle.</p>

<p>The MVP is what you get, but obviously I&#8217;d like to protect my investment as well, so
if it&#8217;s clear that further development is helpful or required, we&#8217;ll do that as well.
The hustler, of course, will have to justify the development cost (You are the CEO
after all).</p>

<p>If you hit the agreed upon success metrics, then lets talk about building <em>your</em> idea.</p>

<p>The pot of gold at the end of the rainbow is that if you&#8217;re really half the hustler
you claim to be:</p>

<ol>
<li>you&#8217;ll end up with a substantial equity stake in a business I think is profitable</li>
<li>you&#8217;ll have a track record</li>
<li>I&#8217;ll probably be pretty excited about building YOUR product too</li>
</ol>


<p>Show me that you add value. It&#8217;s not hard, but it&#8217;s a lot of work.</p>

<p>Regarding a 5k buy in &#8211; A lot of people will be turned off by this. That&#8217;s ok.  Most
of those &#8220;hustlers&#8221; will talk about ideas for the next year and get nothing done.</p>

<p>Any hustler that can&#8217;t raise $5000 isn&#8217;t much of a hustler at all.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll lose some great hustlers with that filter, but I&#8217;m willing to give that up for the
better signal to noise ratio.</p>
