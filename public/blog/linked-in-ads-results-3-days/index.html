	<h1 class="title">Linked in Ads Results (3 Days)</h1>
	<div class="entry-content"><p>I wrote last week about my experience <a href="http://ezliu.com/getting-started-with-linked-in-ads/">getting started with Linked In ads</a>.</p>

<p>So far, the Linked In ad experiment so far has been&#8230; underwhelming.  In fairness, it has only been 3 days, 2 of which were the weekend, but so far, Linked In advertising doesn&#8217;t look like an effective strategy for <a href="http://www.rocketlease.com">Rocket Lease</a>.</p>

<h2>Too Slow</h2>


<p>My favorite thing about Linked In ads is that you can filter down to a highly targeted audience to advertise to.  Unfortunately, as a result, I didn&#8217;t get very many impressions.</p>

<p><a href="http://ezliu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/linkedin.png"><img title="linkedin" src="http://ezliu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/linkedin.png" alt="" width="969" height="173" /></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 3 days I got just over 1000 impressions. As expected, the CTR is lower than the Google Adwords CTR of 1.9%.  Since they are different mediums with different use cases, I didn&#8217;t have a basis for estimating what the CTR would be, but I Was <em>hoping</em> it&#8217;d be &gt; 0.0%.</p>

<p>At that rate, it&#8217;s hard to justify spending time on managing the Linked In ad campaign.  I&#8217;ll most likely switch over to pay per click soon to see how many impressions it takes me to get a click and see if that works better than CPM.  If I don&#8217;t get clicks, I may consider expanding my target audience to see if I can start collecting free impressions &#8211; even if I don&#8217;t get clicks, I&#8217;d consider it a win to be able to get impressions for free or cheap, because it might have an impact on my ability to make a conversion for that user if they ever do stop by my site through some other channel.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>How To Take Advantage of Linked In&#8217;s Suboptimal Pricing Scheme</h2>


<p>I could speed up the impressions by opening up by target audience, but I&#8217;d have to open the audience up to less interested groups, raising my price. Linked In makes the minimum bid for clicks or impressions the same, regardless of the target audience you select.  This is a bit counterintuitive &#8211; seems like it should be more expensive for highly targeted audiences.</p>

<p>The play to get the most value is to run campaigns for very small groups, so you can optimize for every tiny subset of the population.  It&#8217;s time consuming, but will almost certainly result in the best Cost per Conversion.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Needs Work</h1>


<p>The Linked In ad platform generally needs work.  The single most annoying element to me is the lack of explanation of how toggling the various inputs will impact my final campaign.</p>

<p>Less annoying, but the sort of thing that worries me and makes me think that Linked In isn&#8217;t paying any attention to their Ads group &#8211; This morning I got an email that stated supposed stats about my 2 campaigns (most importantly, that I had a non-zero amount of clicks). However, if you compare it to the screenshot above from inside my Linked In Ads dashboard,  I haven&#8217;t registered any clicks.</p>

<p><a href="http://ezliu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/email.png"><img title="email" src="http://ezliu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/email.png" alt="" width="574" height="310" /></a></p>

<p>2 mistakes in the email:</p>

<ol>
    <li>The actual campaigns have *zero* clicks, so the 0.046% CTR is wrong.</li>
    <li>The 2 campaign summaries in the email display the *same* (incorrect) CTR.</li>
</ol>


<div>Linked In needs to do a better job telling people what they&#8217;ll get for raising their bid as well. Tell me what I stand to gain by bidding more!</div>


<p>I still have $53 of advertising, but I doubt these ads are going to pan out for Rocket Lease.</p>
