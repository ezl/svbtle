	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I want to be able to know what site referred users to my site.</p>

<p>More specifically, I want to be able to look back in a month, and say &#8220;users from Linked In did X over their next 10 visits.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Doesn&#8217;t Google Analytics do that?</h2>


<p>Not really. Google Analytics, as far as I know, will tell me where a user came from for a visit, but won&#8217;t let me tie all the future behavior of the site user to their original referer.</p>

<h2>Why Is That Important?</h2>


<p><a href="http://www.rocketlease.com">Rocket Lease</a> has different types of users. Small landlords, big landlords, property managers, leasing agents. While they interact with the site in similar ways, the strategy for connecting with each class of users differs and (I suspect) the total lifetime value of each customer class will vary.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.rocketlease.com"><img src="/images/rl2-300x156.png" alt="" width="300" height="156" /></a></p>


<p>For example, I intend to advertise on various landlord and property manager forums. Professional property managers tend to manage more properties than a landlord owns, so they likely have higher lifetime value (LTV) and I might be willing to pay more per property manager conversion.</p>

<p>I need to know how much time/effort/money to allocate to advertising on Property Manager Forum X vs reddit/r/smalllandlords.</p>

<p>If there&#8217;s a real difference in LTV based on user class, measuring global user LTV is a surefire way to inefficiently allocate advertising dollars.</p>

<h2>Just a Little Bit Of Middleware</h2>


<p>I had (still have) a nagging feeling that I was solving a solved problem, but I couldn&#8217;t find someone else who had done it, so here&#8217;s what I did.</p>

<pre class="code"><code>
# 2 space indent because my blog is skinny
class OriginalRefererMiddleware(object):
  def process_request(self, request):
    referer = request.META.get("HTTP_REFERER")
    host = request.META.get("HTTP_HOST")
    path_info = request.META.get("PATH_INFO")

    if not "ORIGINAL_HTTP_REFERER" in request.session.keys():
      request.session['ORIGINAL_HTTP_REFERER'] = referer

    if not 'ENTRY_PAGE' in request.session.keys():
      request.session['ENTRY_PAGE'] = host + path_info
</code></pre>




<br />


<p>HTTP requests come with a HTTP_REFERER header that me what page the user clicked through from. So if a user ends on my landing page from linked in, if I extract the HTTP_HEADER, it&#8217;ll say linked in. But then if they go to my FAQ, now the referer is &#8221;<strong>rocketlease.com</strong>&#8221;, then if they sign up from there, the referer will be &#8221;<strong>rocketlease.com/faq</strong>&#8221;.</p>

<p>Instead, the first time (and only the first time) a user lands on any page served by me, I save the value of the referer. Then when the user finally registers, I just dump the original_referer to my database so at any future time I can determine how any user originally arrived at my site.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m planning on experimenting with LinkedIn, Facebook, and Bing ads in the next 2 weeks, so hopefully this will help me determine where I should be allocating ad spend. Linked In and Facebook in particular make it possible for me to target certain classes of users. Rocket Lease basically never makes an actual sale on the initial interaction with a user, so using the ad services&#8217; built in analytics isn&#8217;t sufficient to determine value of a customer class.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>My old gym has a website that renders terribly on mobile, yet everybody at the gym goes to it every day to see the workout (that may sound weird, just trust me that it&#8217;s a typical crossfit gym thing).</p>

<p>Everybody goes to the site every day to see ONE thing: the workout of the day.  Then you get there and have to pinch and zoom to read it.</p>

<p>I want a mobile version. So I threw together my own stylesheet for it. It&#8217;d be great if I could show my friends.</p>

<h2><strong>Somebody Please Build This</strong></h2>


<p><strong>http://yoursitecouldlooklike.com</strong></p>

<p>&#8220;Your Site Could Look Like&#8221; is a website. Sort of like <strong>bitly, but it doesn&#8217;t just redirect, it loads the target page AND adds additional stylesheet rules</strong> to it. Basically, it lets you apply any css to any website and show it off to your friends (or the customer who you are trying to woo).</p>

<h2><strong>How it works</strong></h2>


<p>On the main page there are 2 input fields and a submit button.</p>

<blockquote>
<div>1) Target Site URL:</div>
<div>2) CSS file location:</div>
<div>3) [Submit button]</div>
</blockquote>


<p>User puts in a website and an alt stylesheet for it. On clicking submit, they get back a unique url:</p>

<blockquote>
<div><strong>http://yoursitecouldlooklike.com/xT6j2</strong></div></blockquote>


<p>Set up an nginx/apache reverse proxy. Whenever someone accesses that URL, the service curls the target site (1), inserts the contents of the CSS file immediately before the closing html tag (2), then serves the page to the customer.</p>

<p>If you want to be fancy, you can count page views, do analytics on the ip addresses that access it, etc. You can also let people insert their own js file. Will someone build this please?</p>

Really high highs and really low lows&#8230; such is startup life&#8230;</p>

<p>Pretty crazy week for <a href="http://www.rocketlease.com">Rocket Lease</a>.  I don&#8217;t expect startup life to be easy, but its been a bit of a rollercoaster and I&#8217;m exhausted.</p>

<p>In the span of 48 hours, we&#8217;ve been evicted from our insanely gorgeous office space, had our best 2 days of business ever, gotten our credit reports (our core product) shut off by our vendor, and gotten 4 amazing interns.</p>

<h2>Highlights</h2>


<p><strong>Best office space ever:</strong> Rocket Lease has been sharing extra office space with an insanely awesome startup, KM, who has probably the most insanely gorgeous office space I&#8217;ve seen to date.  They gave us an unbeatable deal in the spirit of founders helping founders / startups helping startups. Unbelievable space. Just have to post some pics to brag&#8230;</p>

<p><a href="/images/2012-06-12-11.17.31.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-224" title="2012-06-12 11.17.31" src="/images/2012-06-12-11.17.31-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><a href="/images/2012-06-12-11.17.57.jpg"><img title="2012-06-12 11.17.57" src="/images/2012-06-12-11.17.57-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><a href="/images/2012-06-12-11.18.26.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-226" title="2012-06-12 11.18.26" src="/images/2012-06-12-11.18.26-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Amazing team and interns:</strong> We currently have 2 full timers (me + Mike) and 4 college interns (Alec, Alper, Jason, John). Mike did a phenomenal job getting really sharp, smart, entrepreneurial interns who really connect with the project, and I am/was looking forward to an awesome summer.  Anyways, team of 6. This is an important point.</p>

<p>When too much is going right, you almost have to expect something to go wrong in startup land&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Credit report malfunction!!</strong> Due to a communication error with our credit vendor, Rocket Lease&#8217;s credit reports were turned off for almost 2 days. Those 2 days happened to be the highest 2-day application submission volume we&#8217;ve had to date (13 applications, not a big deal in the grand scheme, but a big deal to me!).</p>

<p>When the issue was finally resolved with the credit vendor, I breathed a sigh of relief, because it was super stressful to be getting paying customers that we couldn&#8217;t serve.</p>

<p><strong>Evicted!!</strong> Within an hour of the credit issue resolution, KM&#8217;s landlords asked them to &#8220;remove any non-KM people from the space&#8221;. Uh oh. Trouble in paradise. Now we have a team of 6 and we&#8217;re evicted. Homeless team of 6 is a problem because its definitely too big for us to be using starbucks as the office now&#8230;</p>

<h2>*Sigh*</h2>


<p>So it goes. The good news is that the interns are still very upbeat and are rolling with the punches.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d still like to try to see if there&#8217;s a chance we can strike a deal where the landlord will be cool with us staying, but I haven&#8217;t been able to connect with them, so I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;m getting ignored.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m really committed to making sure the interns extract a lot of value out of this relationship, so I want to make sure we&#8217;re in a stable place, but now I&#8217;m scrambling to find space.  I have a couple of leads, but I don&#8217;t want to pull in favors that will end up being too costly for me in the long run, so I&#8217;m treading lightly.</p>

<p>If anyone can temporarily house 6 of us for a week or two while we try to get our feet on the ground, there will be much karma returned.</p>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/craigslist/">Popular Craigslist Spam Tactics for Profit (and for Evil)</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&#8217;ve always enjoyed <a href="http://davegooden.com/2011/05/how-airbnb-became-a-billion-dollar-company/">Dave Gooden&#8217;s fantastic writeup</a> about how AirBnB benefitted from email marketing tactics on Craigslist and wondered how prevalent the use of such tactics was. (It&#8217;d also be interesting to know if that happens a lot <em>more</em> after his blog post was published)</p>

<p>Mike L and I were chatting about it and I decided to chronicle a few craigslist scam/spam/marketing techniques we&#8217;ve seen (with <a href="http://ezl.github.com/craigslistspam/">links to the actual email threads in each section</a>)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-205" title="kimmie" src="/images/kimmie.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="320" /></p>

<h2><strong>&#8220;Unthreatening Potential Female Roommate Just Wants Confirmation That You Can Pay Bills&#8221;</strong></h2>


<p><strong>AKA:</strong> &#8220;Please Run A Credit Check&#8221;
<strong>Actual Example:</strong> <a href="http://ezl.github.com/craigslistspam/rental1.html">credit</a>
<strong>Beneficiary:</strong> Free Credit Report.com</p>

<p>Mike was looking for a new apartment and responded to an ad in the roommates section. A cute girl responded.</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>Female responder, girls get better response rates, especially cute ones.</li>
    <li>Wants to make sure you&#8217;re not a scammer</li>
    <li>Well written email, very conversational, disarming.</li>
    <li>This email is too well crafted, it is unlikely to have been sent through a text spinner &#8211; which means that its probably more targeted, and the risk of being sent to spam folders is much higher.</li>
    <li>Really LONG email. Seriously, whoever did this should rethink it, because nobody reads emails that long. Or is it part of the play? It clearly COULDN&#8217;T be a spam message!</li>
    <li>Girl is believably cute, not devastatingly hot.</li>
    <li>Eating ice cream in the picture. Come on, how non-threatening is that?</li>
    <li>Asks you to send her credit check info, but as a helpful citizen tells you to make sure to withold your SSN. Again, she&#8217;s not a scammer! Conveniently recommends FreeCreditReport.com</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Their action:</strong> There are two common plays here.</p>

<ul>
    <li>post ads on craigslist seeking roommates. Whenever someone responds, send them this email encouraging them to try out freecreditreport.com</li>
    <li>Respond to ads where people are seeking roomates. If they respond back, game on.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Benefit of this:</strong> HUGE reduction of total email send volume, everyone who responds to you is already qualifying themselves as an interested candidate and giving you a real email address.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="/images/banana.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-78" title="banana" src="/images/banana-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>

<h2><strong>&#8220;Helpful Internet Citizen Trying To Help You Avoid Contractor Woes&#8221;</strong></h2>


<p><strong>Note:</strong> This spam was found to be a third party abusing an affiliate program. The actual company reached out and informed me that they don&#8217;t condone that behavior and have banned the affiliate marketer. Their logo above was replaced by a photo of a banana. Why? Because I happened to have one in my Wordpress Media Library.</p>

<p><strong>AKA:</strong> &#8220;Let Me Recommend A Site I&#8217;ve Used Successfully&#8221;
<strong>Actual Example:</strong> <a href="http://ezl.github.com/craigslistspam/odesk.html">contractor site</a>
<strong>Beneficiary:</strong> An contracting site</p>

<p>I was looking for someone to reskin a wordpress blog for me. A very helpful girl named Ava who recently had a bad craigslist experience wanted to let me know that a specific contracting site gave her better results.</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>Short and sweet</li>
    <li>Also from a girl</li>
    <li>Voice a common concern, just trying to save you the trouble she went through.</li>
    <li>Smoking gun: the link doesn&#8217;t go to the site itself. it goes to a click tracking site. Regular humans don&#8217;t do that.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Their action:</strong> scrape craigslist computer gigs section, respond to everyone and recommend a specific site as a superior alternative.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/images/scam2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-209" title="scam" src="/images/scam2.jpg" alt="" width="210" height="190" /></a></p>

<h2><strong>&#8220;Christian In West Africa Wants To Rent Lovely Home To You&#8221;</strong></h2>


<p><strong>AKA:</strong> &#8220;Give Me All Your Info&#8221;
<strong>Actual Examples:</strong> <a href="http://ezl.github.com/craigslistspam/rental2a.html">[a]</a> <a href="http://ezl.github.com/craigslistspam/rental2b.html">[b]</a> <a href="http://ezl.github.com/craigslistspam/rental2c.html">[c]</a>
<strong>Beneficiary:</strong> Some scammer/identity thief (This is the only one that I find particularly evil.)</p>

<p>I responded to several ads in the craigslist &#8220;apartments for rent&#8221; section. One particular flavor of response stood out.</p>

<p>There were a lot of autoresponses from places with great, submarket rents, and they all ask you to fill out a rental application<strong> including a lot of personal information.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>Responses were all from emails sent to listings where the original poster had used a public email address (as opposed to an anonymized craigslist address)</li>
    <li>Typical pattern is that someone lived in a gorgeous home, but had to go abroad.</li>
    <li>Abroad is typically West Africa, I have no idea why.</li>
    <li>Most of the respondents represent themselves as Christian (a reverand, a family doing missions in west africa, etc.)</li>
    <li>Tend to act as if they are aware you have the upper hand, but need to trust you (suddenly had to move away, need the money, willing to rent to you at a lower price if you&#8217;re a good tenant, just prove it by emailing me your personal information). I think this is a play to disarm your suspicion.</li>
    <li>They generally display some sort of concern that they are going to be scammed themselves or a vulnerability that makes them want to qualify you as a tenant. For example, it is their personal family home, they have their furniture there and want to make sure it&#8217;s in good hands in their absence.</li>
    <li>Prey on typical US perceptions of trustworthiness: Christians, ministers, reverends, families with young children</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Lessons learned:</strong>
Mostly spammers post &#8220;real&#8221; addresses. Real &#8220;real&#8221; people are afraid of posting their address in the open.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="/images/b-e1339030520918-250x300.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-210" title="b" src="/images/b-e1339030520918-250x300.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="300" /></a></p>

<h2><strong>&#8220;Horny Young Co-Ed Wants To Chat&#8221;</strong></h2>


<p><strong>AKA</strong> &#8220;Men Like Nude Women&#8221;
<strong>Actual Examples:</strong> <a href="http://ezl.github.com/craigslistspam/adult.html">http://ezl.github.com/craigslistspam/adult.html</a>
<strong>Beneficiary:</strong> Actually, I don&#8217;t quite get this one. I assume the site somehow generates revenue from desperate men who want to hook up with hot sexy co-eds for free! (just enter your credit card! we won&#8217;t use it! trust us!)</p>

<p>This is pretty interesting actually.</p>

<p>Mike gave a girl a copy of the Redeye, a daily pop culture/sports newspaperlet in Chicago.
He later posted in Missed Connections about it, and received a garbage reply:</p>

<p>Not thinking about it, he responded with a short one liner and unleashed upon himself the fury that is adult website spammers.</p>

<p>Every day since, he has received at least 1 unsolicited emails from different girls just trying to get him to sign up for a site to connect with hot girls like her that want to chat. The really amusing thing is that (1) many of these &#8220;different&#8221; girls somehow have the same picture, and (2) the emails are almost all identical. As a teaser, these girls all send nude pics of themselves, and amazingly, sometimes their nude pics don&#8217;t even look like the same girl (weird, I know).</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>Tries to act like a sexy coed who is afraid YOU are a scammer of some sort. She just wants to make sure she&#8217;s not chatting with a &#8220;cam girl or a bot&#8221;, which is clearly the spammers play to make you think *she* isn&#8217;t a &#8220;cam girl or a bot&#8221;</li>
    <li>Clearly using an automated program to vary the text of the messages, probably as an attempt to avoid email spam filters</li>
    <li>Huge corpus of alternate urls for their site.</li>
    <li>All sent from different email addresses.</li>
    <li>Whose naked photos are these?!</li>
</ul>


<h2>&#8220;Spam&#8221; is not equal to &#8220;Scam&#8221;</h2>


<div><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4079583">Callmeed on HN</a> made a point about distinguishing between &#8220;spam&#8221; and &#8220;scam&#8221;.</div>


<div></div>


<div>The &#8220;Christian in West Africa Wants To Rent Lovely Home To You&#8221; category is the only one that I feel really bad about, because these people are screwing people over. The other ones are just companies doing some guerilla marketing. The &#8220;hot, horny women&#8221; category seems a little sleazy, and I don&#8217;t actually know that they&#8217;re NOT doing bad things with the data they collect (or what they collect), but on the surface it just seems like a spammy campaign to drive traffic.</div>


<h2>Common Characteristics in Many Craigslist Spam/Scam Messages</h2>


<ul>
    <li>Build rapport. Voice a common concern that you probably have to disqualify self as the threat.</li>
    <li>Act as an independent, concerned citizen. recommending a third party service.</li>
    <li>Respondents are female or generally prey on typical American stereotypes of honesty (Christian, African Foreign AID volunteer, social worker).</li>
    <li>Pose as vulnerable to empower the target</li>
    <li>Too good to be true</li>
</ul>


<p>The adult site one amuses me in particular because it is the most technically involved &#8211; clearly using spinner code, likely for spam filter evasion; probably a script that autoregisters accounts with free services, so they might also have to be beating captchas; they are sending the largest total volume of email too, so they probably have to deal sending through lots of proxies to avoid getting blacklisted by the free mail services; tons of domains involved; and at the end of it, it seems like the least likely to get conversions.</p>

<p>Generally I think this stuff is pretty cool. With the exception of the spammers who pretend to give you rental applications, probably as a ploy to steal your identity, I consider these mostly just interesting &#8220;grey hat&#8221; marketing tactics.</p>

<p>Airbnb wasn&#8217;t the only one. I imagine that there are probably even 3rd party &#8220;marketing companies&#8221; that do this for your startup.  I&#8217;d be interested in hearing more about it from the inside &#8211; if you&#8217;re reading this and you know someone who might be willing to talk to me, even anonymously, please connect me.</p>

		<p><a href="http://rocketlease.com">Rocket Lease</a> is pretty ugly.  There I said it.</p>

<p>I know it&#8217;s not the prettiest, and my position until recently has been &#8220;Oh well, but it&#8217;s functional&#8221;, and that matters way more than &#8220;beautiful&#8221;.  Besides, existing players in the market don&#8217;t have gorgeous UI&#8217;s so it&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m losing.</p>

<p>I started checking out the &#8220;Visitors Flow&#8221; section in my Google Analytics today.  I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m reading it right, but from what I can tell, Visitors Flow seems like a poor man&#8217;s funnel analysis, without having done any of the work up front to set it up.  Which is great, because I haven&#8217;t set anything up!</p>

<p>The unfortunate part is that, I&#8217;m getting a ~2.2% signup rate.  I&#8217;m not sure if its that my messaging is unclear or that my site is too ugly, but I&#8217;ve heard (and agree with feedback) that the site is uninviting.  (Also don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s good or bad or if I can do better or who&#8217;s coming to my site, but that&#8217;s something to figure out later&#8230;)</p>

<p>Anyways, all the feedback that my site is ugly and that the &#8220;borrowed&#8221; stock image is terrible has finally sunk in, so I&#8217;m in the process of getting a new landing page ready to test, thanks to my good friend Justin K.  A preview of the landing page (don&#8217;t mind the Lease Rocket / Rocket Lease, Justin was just being playful with that):</p>

<p><a href="/images/photo.jpg"><img src="/images/photo-923x1024.jpg" alt="" title="New Landing Page Mockup" width="450" height="499" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-193" /></a></p>

<p>Simultaneously, Ryan G is working with me to rethink the internal UI and make it clearer to new users what they need to do. Ryan&#8217;s a brilliant UI/UX guy and has really helped me narrow down the screens to the bare essentials, helped make the process more fun, and taught me a ton about UI/UX on the way. The new Rocket Lease dashboard and applications will be much slicker, more inviting to users, and easier to understand.  Can&#8217;t wait to get this stuff live.</p>

<p>Very excited to see if this stuff performs differently and to be able to have something pretty to show off.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I don&#8217;t get a lot of traffic right now. ~80 organic hits a day.</p>

<p>For some reason, Analytics is telling me that a nontrivial portion of my traffic is coming from the queries &#8221;<strong>hello kitty toms</strong>&#8221; and &#8221;<strong>hello kitty house</strong>&#8221;.</p>

<p>They are apparently my second and third most significant traffic sources.  Weirdly the average position for those queries is registering as 54 and 200, which is odd, because (a) who goes to the 20th page of results and clicks on something, and (b) why am I ranking for anything with the phrase  &#8220;hello kitty&#8221; anyways?</p>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/dont-choose-crappy-keywords/">Don&#8217;t Choose Crappy Keywords</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>In my first experiments, I found that <a href="http://ezliu.com/currently-paying-150-per-conversion/">Adwords conversions were costing me almost $150 per conversion</a>. No big surprise, within 10 minutes of looking at the resulting data, I found that I had been bidding for some terrible keywords.</p>

<blockquote>For example:

&#8221;<strong>basic rental agreement</strong>&#8221; &#8211; this sounds like it might be  pretty good, which is why I threw it in the pool, but the conversion rate was far below the average and it generated lots of clicks (ouch).

It&#8217;s deceptively promising sounding, but that particular phrase is missing the point of Rocket Lease.  Rocket Lease does the rental *application*; People searching for a &#8220;rental agreement&#8221; are beyond qualifying tenants and are looking for a standard lease. They don&#8217;t need what I have to offer. Paying for them to visit my site is basically a donation to Google.  The Adwords data confirms this with a 0%  conversion rate for 450 clicks of that phrase. *</blockquote>


<p>Further digging revealed that I was actually bidding for a lot of keywords that contain the phrase &#8220;rental agreement&#8221; &#8211; These, as a a group accounted for a lot of clicks, but a very low conversion rate, and costed me<strong> $464.00 per conversion</strong>, or 3x my average conversion rate.</p>

<p>Just excluding the keywords that include &#8220;rental agreement&#8221; would have brought my conversion cost down <strong>from $149.53 to $101.16 (a 32.9% reduction)</strong>.</p>

<p>Other terms too, like &#8220;Free eviction check&#8221;, didn&#8217;t do so hot for me, which isn&#8217;t surprising considering that&#8217;s not what Rocket Lease does. Hopefully by eliminating the garbage, I can quickly get to even cheaper conversion costs before I even do any on-site conversion optimization.</p>

<p><a href="/images/Money-on-Fire.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-186" title="Money-on-Fire" src="/images/Money-on-Fire.jpg" alt="" width="328" height="366" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Going Forward</strong></p>

<p>My measured conversion value is $4.63 so that still puts me pretty far away from making AdWords economics work out, but I&#8217;m still chasing this thread because:</p>

<ol>
    <li>I think my true conversion value is almost certainly higher. $4.63 was the total estimated conversion value as measured from right after the exploratory AdWords campaign stopped.
        <ul>
            <li>There&#8217;s a bit of lag between conversion and profit (landlord signs up == conversion, profit occurs when the landlord asks an applicant to fill out an application), and</li>
            <li>that number doesn&#8217;t account for return customers.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The initial keyword selection was pretty naive (as the &#8220;rental agreement&#8221; indicates)</li>
    <li>First data also includes exploratory analysis to determine what keywords we should be looking for</li>
    <li>There was a learning period to improve CPC. My friend Jake, during the duration of the initial Adwords run, optimized my campaign substantially for clicks,cutting down my CPC by more than 50% &#8211; however, the data includes the entire learning process.</li>
    <li>There has been no explicit optimization for conversion, through adwords (I think I might get better by controlling max CPC)</li>
    <li>The current site is pretty ugly, and we can probably improve signup/conversion rate on site by making the site better.</li>
</ol>


<p>I can&#8217;t prove this yet, but I would be surprised if my real customer LTV wasn&#8217;t north of $25, and I feel pretty confident that by being smarter about keyword selection, doing a little bit to optimize conversion costs in Adwords, and beautifying the home page, I could probably get the conversion cost below $50.00/conversion.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s still not a win, obviously, but if I&#8217;m right that inexperienced me can get within a factor of 2, I&#8217;m betting there&#8217;s a fighting chance that someone better at Adwords can push that into &#8220;money machine&#8221; territory.</p>

<hr />




<address><span style="color: #999999;">* Surprisingly a high CTR though, I bet its because my domain name contains the word &#8220;Lease&#8221; in it, which probably sounds promising to visitors.</span></address>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This will sound really silly.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been taking support phone calls for <a href="http://www.rocketlease.com/">Rocket Lease</a> and after a few days of awkward phone calls I finally realized that I have no idea how to answer the phone.</p>

<p>I kept going straight into a support call without getting the customer&#8217;s name, and then doing a &#8220;Uh sorry, I forgot your name&#8221; while trying to communicate later.</p>

<p>I kept getting hung up because I was trying to squeeze in a &#8220;how can I help you today?&#8221;, but it felt really awkward try to work that into the intro.</p>

<p>So I just called T Mobile and Bank of America to listen to their canned scripts.</p>

<blockquote>&#8220;Thank you for calling Bank of America, my name is Jim, may I have your first and last name please.&#8221;

&#8220;Thank you for calling T-Mobile, my name is Kathy, to better assist you may I have your name please?&#8221;</blockquote>


<p>My assumption was that an intro has to convey:
- The company you are calling
- My name
- Request for your name
- Indicate desire to assist you</p>

<p>Turns out the anatomy of a support call intro doesn&#8217;t include the last item. The weird stuff you don&#8217;t think about when starting a business&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><strong>$149.53, actually</strong>. That&#8217;s how much I paid per conversion while experimenting with Adwords this month.</p>

<p>My best estimate is that a conversion is worth $4.69 *, so I&#8217;m overpaying a bit.  I&#8217;m no expert, but I&#8217;m pretty sure that&#8217;s not good.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/images/CPC21.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-153" title="CPC2" src="/images/CPC21.png" alt="" width="782" height="210" /></a> <a href="/images/CPC2.png">
</a></p>


<p>Before I continue, I want to explain how Rocket Lease works to explain what a conversion is and why I chose that particular conversion metric.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How Rocket Lease Works</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.rocketlease.com"><img class="alignright" title="Easy Online Rental Applications" src="/images/rl2-300x156.png" alt="Easy Online Rental Applications" width="300" height="156" /></a></p>

<p>The tricky thing about Rocket Lease conversions is that the people I want to drive to my site (landlords) actually never pay me directly (the applicants do).</p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to tie AdWords conversions to actual profit, but the profit event can occur well after the Landlord signs up for the site.To put the conversion action as close to profit as possible, I decided that <strong>the action of inputting rental information is a conversion</strong>. It&#8217;s an involved enough process that it&#8217;s probably an indicator of real intent to use the site. **</p>

<blockquote>If you&#8217;re curious, here&#8217;s a long description of why I chose Rental creation as the conversion metric.  If you&#8217;re not curious, skip this section.

The rental market is essentially made of Landlords and Applicants. Landlords will typically:
<ol>
    <li>Ask Applicants to submit personal information</li>
    <li>Use that information to evaluate the candidacy of the Applicant.</li>
</ol>
When using Rocket Lease, landlords who want to use an online application enter information about their vacant rental property, then Rocket Lease creates a unique URL for that rental for distribution to applicants.

Though landlords have ultimate deciding power over which application (paper or electronic) they use, generally *Applicants* actually pay the application fee. So the actual customer, the Landlord, who I am trying to convince to sign up for Rocket Lease, doesn&#8217;t ever directly pay Rocket Lease.

In fact, the browser session that actually generates revenue will be not be the one that came to the site, and could be long after the landlord signup. That makes it hard (impossible?) to tie the adwords clicks to profit, so the idea is to get as close to &#8220;intent to distribute a Rocket Lease application&#8221; as possible.</blockquote>


<p><strong>So&#8230; How&#8217;d That Pan Out?</strong></p>

<p>Uh, so&#8230; back to<strong> $149.53 conversions</strong>. That&#8217;s what it costed me to get a landlord to sign up and input rental information. So far, <strong>each conversion pays $4.63</strong>. Obviously not a sustainable venture.  Yes, I&#8217;m out some cash, but overall, I consider it paying for information, and I&#8217;m happy to have done it.</p>

<p>Before I started, I:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Didn&#8217;t even have a rough idea of what my customer value was, so now at least I have a starting point with real data from strangers.</li>
    <li>Didn&#8217;t know what my CPCs would cost, so I didn&#8217;t know if SEM strategies were viable (still don&#8217;t, experiment suggests no, but I think I can do MUCH better &#8211; further testing required).</li>
</ul>


<p>Also:</p>

<ul>
    <li>I found a lot of new keywords that were driving traffic to Rocket Lease, so that will help me focus on other organic words and I have a larger pool of SEM words to target.</li>
    <li>I learned a ton about paid search.</li>
</ul>


<p>There were also a lot of keywords in there that costed money but are clearly not likely to convert, so I think I can substantially reduce my CPC by using negative matching and further optimizing. Obviously I have a long way to go to get close, but I got enough value out of it that I&#8217;ll probably continue to experiment a bit with AdWords.</p>

<p>Hopefully the LTV of customers is actually higher, too, so there might be hope yet.</p>

<p>Paying $150/conversion is obviously not fun, but it&#8217;s a starting point, and I&#8217;m excited to see where I can go with it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr />




<address><span style="color: #999999;">* Admittedly conservative. This is based on my current historical data for what users have made me in the short life of Rocket Lease, assuming each user has already realized his/her full LTV for the site. This is likely/hopefully not true, and I actually expect the true LTV to end up being a multiple of my current &#8220;estimate&#8221;. However, I l ike playing conservatively, and if I can be profitable to this conversion value number, then anything else will be gravy.</span></address>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/do-single-founders-work-harder/">Do Single Founders Work Harder?</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I was at General Assembly tonight, and like most nights I&#8217;m there, I was one of the last people there. It actually amazes me that the startup space is typically mostly cleared out by 8pm. As far as I can tell, this is true of Projective Space, New Work City, and We Work Labs as well. Weekends are equally sparse &#8211; I basically have the run of the place on a Saturday. *</p>

<div>
<div>Do single founders work harder?</div>
<div>Do they HAVE to wok harder?</div>
</div>


<div></div>


<div>
<div>By &#8220;harder&#8221; I  mean &#8220;more hours&#8221;. I am not asking, &#8220;Do single founders work better?&#8221; (I think there are a lot of reasons to suspect they don&#8217;t). Maybe, as a way to compensate for the other shortcomings of being a single founder, we have to work more to have a fighting shot.</div>
</div>


<div></div>


<div>Before anyone accuses me of being self congratulatory or judgmental of teams, I&#8217;m not saying that single founders DO work harder. I&#8217;m actually asking a question to explain the phenomenon where these coworking spaces filled with teams empty out by dinner. My friend Hugo says its because New York founders are lazy, but I don&#8217;t buy that.</div>


<div></div>


<div>There are certainly many penalties for being a single founder, so I wonder if they are forced to work harder/more. I&#8217;m OBSESSED with my startup, Rocket Lease. I think about rental applications incessantly. And I get to work on it whenever I want, which is more or less &#8220;when I&#8217;m awake&#8221; (I&#8217;m not suggesting this is healthy or advisable, its just what I&#8217;ve been doing.).</div>


<div></div>


<div>When I&#8217;m obsessed with something its really hard to keep me from doing it if I have the option. So are the startup teams  in New York not obsessed, obsessed in the privacy of their own homes, or just not putting in as many hours as single founders?</div>


<div></div>


<div>* Except for Ryan W &#8211; that guy is a team, and he works insanely hard and good all the time. I don&#8217; understand how its possible to operate at that level, that consistently, for that long.</div>
