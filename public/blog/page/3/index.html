	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>In my first experiments, I found that <a href="http://ezliu.com/currently-paying-150-per-conversion/">Adwords conversions were costing me almost $150 per conversion</a>. No big surprise, within 10 minutes of looking at the resulting data, I found that I had been bidding for some terrible keywords.</p>

<blockquote>For example:

&#8221;<strong>basic rental agreement</strong>&#8221; &#8211; this sounds like it might be  pretty good, which is why I threw it in the pool, but the conversion rate was far below the average and it generated lots of clicks (ouch).

It&#8217;s deceptively promising sounding, but that particular phrase is missing the point of Rocket Lease.  Rocket Lease does the rental *application*; People searching for a &#8220;rental agreement&#8221; are beyond qualifying tenants and are looking for a standard lease. They don&#8217;t need what I have to offer. Paying for them to visit my site is basically a donation to Google.  The Adwords data confirms this with a 0%  conversion rate for 450 clicks of that phrase. *</blockquote>


<p>Further digging revealed that I was actually bidding for a lot of keywords that contain the phrase &#8220;rental agreement&#8221; &#8211; These, as a a group accounted for a lot of clicks, but a very low conversion rate, and costed me<strong> $464.00 per conversion</strong>, or 3x my average conversion rate.</p>

<p>Just excluding the keywords that include &#8220;rental agreement&#8221; would have brought my conversion cost down <strong>from $149.53 to $101.16 (a 32.9% reduction)</strong>.</p>

<p>Other terms too, like &#8220;Free eviction check&#8221;, didn&#8217;t do so hot for me, which isn&#8217;t surprising considering that&#8217;s not what Rocket Lease does. Hopefully by eliminating the garbage, I can quickly get to even cheaper conversion costs before I even do any on-site conversion optimization.</p>

<p><a href="/images/Money-on-Fire.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-186" title="Money-on-Fire" src="/images/Money-on-Fire.jpg" alt="" width="328" height="366" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Going Forward</strong></p>

<p>My measured conversion value is $4.63 so that still puts me pretty far away from making AdWords economics work out, but I&#8217;m still chasing this thread because:</p>

<ol>
    <li>I think my true conversion value is almost certainly higher. $4.63 was the total estimated conversion value as measured from right after the exploratory AdWords campaign stopped.
        <ul>
            <li>There&#8217;s a bit of lag between conversion and profit (landlord signs up == conversion, profit occurs when the landlord asks an applicant to fill out an application), and</li>
            <li>that number doesn&#8217;t account for return customers.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The initial keyword selection was pretty naive (as the &#8220;rental agreement&#8221; indicates)</li>
    <li>First data also includes exploratory analysis to determine what keywords we should be looking for</li>
    <li>There was a learning period to improve CPC. My friend Jake, during the duration of the initial Adwords run, optimized my campaign substantially for clicks,cutting down my CPC by more than 50% &#8211; however, the data includes the entire learning process.</li>
    <li>There has been no explicit optimization for conversion, through adwords (I think I might get better by controlling max CPC)</li>
    <li>The current site is pretty ugly, and we can probably improve signup/conversion rate on site by making the site better.</li>
</ol>


<p>I can&#8217;t prove this yet, but I would be surprised if my real customer LTV wasn&#8217;t north of $25, and I feel pretty confident that by being smarter about keyword selection, doing a little bit to optimize conversion costs in Adwords, and beautifying the home page, I could probably get the conversion cost below $50.00/conversion.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s still not a win, obviously, but if I&#8217;m right that inexperienced me can get within a factor of 2, I&#8217;m betting there&#8217;s a fighting chance that someone better at Adwords can push that into &#8220;money machine&#8221; territory.</p>

<address><span style="color: #999999;">* Surprisingly a high CTR though, I bet its because my domain name contains the word &#8220;Lease&#8221; in it, which probably sounds promising to visitors.</span></address>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This will sound really silly.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been taking support phone calls for <a href="http://www.rocketlease.com/">Rocket Lease</a> and after a few days of awkward phone calls I finally realized that I have no idea how to answer the phone.</p>

<p>I kept going straight into a support call without getting the customer&#8217;s name, and then doing a &#8220;Uh sorry, I forgot your name&#8221; while trying to communicate later.</p>

<p>I kept getting hung up because I was trying to squeeze in a &#8220;how can I help you today?&#8221;, but it felt really awkward try to work that into the intro.</p>

<p>So I just called T Mobile and Bank of America to listen to their canned scripts.</p>

<blockquote>&#8220;Thank you for calling Bank of America, my name is Jim, may I have your first and last name please.&#8221;

&#8220;Thank you for calling T-Mobile, my name is Kathy, to better assist you may I have your name please?&#8221;</blockquote>


<p>My assumption was that an intro has to convey:
- The company you are calling
- My name
- Request for your name
- Indicate desire to assist you</p>

<p>Turns out the anatomy of a support call intro doesn&#8217;t include the last item. The weird stuff you don&#8217;t think about when starting a business&#8230;</p>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/currently-paying-150-per-conversion/">Currently Paying $150 Per Conversion</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><strong>$149.53, actually</strong>. That&#8217;s how much I paid per conversion while experimenting with Adwords this month.</p>

<p>My best estimate is that a conversion is worth $4.69 *, so I&#8217;m overpaying a bit.  I&#8217;m no expert, but I&#8217;m pretty sure that&#8217;s not good.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/images/CPC21.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-153" title="CPC2" src="/images/CPC21.png" alt="" width="782" height="210" /></a> <a href="/images/CPC2.png">
</a></p>


<p>Before I continue, I want to explain how Rocket Lease works to explain what a conversion is and why I chose that particular conversion metric.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How Rocket Lease Works</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.rocketlease.com"><img class="alignright" title="Easy Online Rental Applications" src="/images/rl2-300x156.png" alt="Easy Online Rental Applications" width="300" height="156" /></a></p>

<p>The tricky thing about Rocket Lease conversions is that the people I want to drive to my site (landlords) actually never pay me directly (the applicants do).</p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to tie AdWords conversions to actual profit, but the profit event can occur well after the Landlord signs up for the site.To put the conversion action as close to profit as possible, I decided that <strong>the action of inputting rental information is a conversion</strong>. It&#8217;s an involved enough process that it&#8217;s probably an indicator of real intent to use the site. **</p>

<blockquote>If you&#8217;re curious, here&#8217;s a long description of why I chose Rental creation as the conversion metric.  If you&#8217;re not curious, skip this section.

The rental market is essentially made of Landlords and Applicants. Landlords will typically:
<ol>
    <li>Ask Applicants to submit personal information</li>
    <li>Use that information to evaluate the candidacy of the Applicant.</li>
</ol>
When using Rocket Lease, landlords who want to use an online application enter information about their vacant rental property, then Rocket Lease creates a unique URL for that rental for distribution to applicants.

Though landlords have ultimate deciding power over which application (paper or electronic) they use, generally *Applicants* actually pay the application fee. So the actual customer, the Landlord, who I am trying to convince to sign up for Rocket Lease, doesn&#8217;t ever directly pay Rocket Lease.

In fact, the browser session that actually generates revenue will be not be the one that came to the site, and could be long after the landlord signup. That makes it hard (impossible?) to tie the adwords clicks to profit, so the idea is to get as close to &#8220;intent to distribute a Rocket Lease application&#8221; as possible.</blockquote>


<p><strong>So&#8230; How&#8217;d That Pan Out?</strong></p>

<p>Uh, so&#8230; back to<strong> $149.53 conversions</strong>. That&#8217;s what it costed me to get a landlord to sign up and input rental information. So far, <strong>each conversion pays $4.63</strong>. Obviously not a sustainable venture.  Yes, I&#8217;m out some cash, but overall, I consider it paying for information, and I&#8217;m happy to have done it.</p>

<p>Before I started, I:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Didn&#8217;t even have a rough idea of what my customer value was, so now at least I have a starting point with real data from strangers.</li>
    <li>Didn&#8217;t know what my CPCs would cost, so I didn&#8217;t know if SEM strategies were viable (still don&#8217;t, experiment suggests no, but I think I can do MUCH better &#8211; further testing required).</li>
</ul>


<p>Also:</p>

<ul>
    <li>I found a lot of new keywords that were driving traffic to Rocket Lease, so that will help me focus on other organic words and I have a larger pool of SEM words to target.</li>
    <li>I learned a ton about paid search.</li>
</ul>


<p>There were also a lot of keywords in there that costed money but are clearly not likely to convert, so I think I can substantially reduce my CPC by using negative matching and further optimizing. Obviously I have a long way to go to get close, but I got enough value out of it that I&#8217;ll probably continue to experiment a bit with AdWords.</p>

<p>Hopefully the LTV of customers is actually higher, too, so there might be hope yet.</p>

<p>Paying $150/conversion is obviously not fun, but it&#8217;s a starting point, and I&#8217;m excited to see where I can go with it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr />




<address><span style="color: #999999;">* Admittedly conservative. This is based on my current historical data for what users have made me in the short life of Rocket Lease, assuming each user has already realized his/her full LTV for the site. This is likely/hopefully not true, and I actually expect the true LTV to end up being a multiple of my current &#8220;estimate&#8221;. However, I l ike playing conservatively, and if I can be profitable to this conversion value number, then anything else will be gravy.</span></address>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/do-single-founders-work-harder/">Do Single Founders Work Harder?</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I was at General Assembly tonight, and like most nights I&#8217;m there, I was one of the last people there. It actually amazes me that the startup space is typically mostly cleared out by 8pm. As far as I can tell, this is true of Projective Space, New Work City, and We Work Labs as well. Weekends are equally sparse &#8211; I basically have the run of the place on a Saturday. *</p>

<div>
<div>Do single founders work harder?</div>
<div>Do they HAVE to wok harder?</div>
</div>


<div></div>


<div>
<div>By &#8220;harder&#8221; I  mean &#8220;more hours&#8221;. I am not asking, &#8220;Do single founders work better?&#8221; (I think there are a lot of reasons to suspect they don&#8217;t). Maybe, as a way to compensate for the other shortcomings of being a single founder, we have to work more to have a fighting shot.</div>
</div>


<div></div>


<div>Before anyone accuses me of being self congratulatory or judgmental of teams, I&#8217;m not saying that single founders DO work harder. I&#8217;m actually asking a question to explain the phenomenon where these coworking spaces filled with teams empty out by dinner. My friend Hugo says its because New York founders are lazy, but I don&#8217;t buy that.</div>


<div></div>


<div>There are certainly many penalties for being a single founder, so I wonder if they are forced to work harder/more. I&#8217;m OBSESSED with my startup, Rocket Lease. I think about rental applications incessantly. And I get to work on it whenever I want, which is more or less &#8220;when I&#8217;m awake&#8221; (I&#8217;m not suggesting this is healthy or advisable, its just what I&#8217;ve been doing.).</div>


<div></div>


<div>When I&#8217;m obsessed with something its really hard to keep me from doing it if I have the option. So are the startup teams  in New York not obsessed, obsessed in the privacy of their own homes, or just not putting in as many hours as single founders?</div>


<div></div>


<div>* Except for Ryan W &#8211; that guy is a team, and he works insanely hard and good all the time. I don&#8217; understand how its possible to operate at that level, that consistently, for that long.</div>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/open-book-rocket-lease/">Open Book: Rocket Lease</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I am considering posting more openly about what I&#8217;m working on with <a href="http://rocketlease.com">Rocket Lease</a>. I generally have enjoyed when other entrepreneurs have done this (Patrick McKenzie of Bingo Card Creator and Johannes Borchardt of http://droid-blog.net/ come to mind).</p>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;attachment_37&#8221; align=&#8221;alignright&#8221; width=&#8221;210&#8221; caption=&#8221;Easy Online Rental Applications&#8221;]<a href="/images/rl2.png"><img class=" wp-image-37 " title="Easy Online Rental Applications" src="/images/05/rl2-300x156.png" alt="Easy Online Rental Applications" width="210" height="109" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>I have no interest in writing a &#8220;how to&#8221; guide. I&#8217;m considering just being transparent about what I&#8217;m working on, what I&#8217;m struggling with, how I&#8217;m doing it (not how you should do it), and where I&#8217;m allocating my efforts.</p>

<p><strong>Possible Benefits:</strong>
So far I&#8217;ve really enjoyed the feedback I&#8217;ve gotten from people since beginning to write this blog. Having a public place for my writing has connected me to people I would likely have never gotten in touch with.</p>

<p><strong>Concerns:</strong>
The rental space is really crowded. There&#8217;s a lurking fear that I shouldn&#8217;t publicly broadcast my approach to making Rocket Lease awesome. I have competitors. Right now Rocket Lease isn&#8217;t particularly competitive in the space, but I want it to be, and the fear is that by being open about where I&#8217;m allocating my efforts I&#8217;ll undermine my own efforts. Also, as of now, I&#8217;m a single founder. Multiple cofounder teams have a body count advantage over me.</p>

<p>Going to mull this over a bit, but I&#8217;m leaning heavily towards doing it &#8211; unless I get too scared.</p>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/founderarrogance/">Founder Arrogance</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A good friend of mine, let’s call him “Christopher Toppino”, who may or may not be working on a really cool startup called <a href="http://rentshare.com">RentShare</a>, that does <a href="http://rentshare.com">online rent payments</a> and expense sharing between roommates, recently received an unsolicited email:</p>

<blockquote><strong>Subject</strong>: (no subject)
<strong>Date</strong>: May 6, 2012 9:17 AM
<strong>Message</strong>:
Hey there.
Fellow entrepreneur here. I heard about your your site in brooklyn mag and had some thoughts.
<ol>
<li>It’s important to be able to bill different amounts to different roommates for example if we go to a bar and order a different number of drinks we shouldn’t pay the same amount.</li>
<li>Credit card processing fees are really high, so nobody will use that for paying rent.</li>
<li>You should expand the product to be able to split expenses among all friends.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>


<p>I happened to be sitting with Chris when he received this email. He didn’t think much of it, but it really got me thinking.</p>

<p><strong>First impression</strong>: Sweet! That’s so cool. Someone wrote you!
<strong>Second impression</strong>: Pop quiz, asshole. How many of those ideas do you think Chris hasn’t thought of?</p>

<p><strong>Ideas</strong></p>

<p>I love talking ideas with people. I love being introduced to new ideas. New ideas often come from other people. There’s no greater compliment than another person volunteering their time and mental energy to something I’ve poured my heart and soul into.</p>

<p>There’s a part of me that jumps with joy whenever someone is so interested in my startup that they spend their valuable time to think about it and give me recommendations/advice.</p>

<p>But sometimes there’s a part of me that cringes because the advice belies an arrogance and presumption of idiocy. And the dividing line between happiness and fury is vanishingly thin.</p>

<p>Part of it is <strong>delivery</strong>. You can do a lot to land on the side away from fury by prefacing a sentence with:</p>

<blockquote>“I’m sure you’ve thought about this way more than me, but…”
“Hmm, I don’t know much about your space, but…”
“There’s probably a good reason why you’re not doing this already…”</blockquote>


<p>These are really transparent, but effective ways that you can soften statements. Sort of like the startup founders’ advice equivalent of:</p>

<blockquote>“I don’t want to sound like a jerk, but… [proceed to say jerk thing]“</blockquote>


<p>No doubt, part of the knee-jerk rejection response is <strong>fear that I’ve have missed something</strong> incredibly obvious that some stranger will be able to call to my attention. It’s really easy to get caught up in your own world, and an outside perspective can do wonders to put things into perspective.</p>

<p>However, the biggest component that determines my response is <strong>how much thought went into the advice</strong>. If the advice is from another founder and is just scratching the surface, it’s almost an insult — “Oh hey, i’ve thought about this for 2 seconds, and I have the brilliant insight that is going to make your startup finally succeed.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Founders Are ________.</strong></p>

<p>Startup founders are<strong> smart and ambitious</strong>. They create things, often from nothing. They are building empires and fortunes out of their sheer creative genius.</p>

<p>Startup founders are <strong>problem solvers</strong>. They see broken things around us, inefficiencies in the system, and they want to make it better, easier, faster, cheaper.</p>

<p>And startup founders are <strong>arrogant</strong>. As a founder, you need a deep conviction that your project is going to be a success. And odds are good that someone has done something similar before you, so you’re implicitly asserting that you can succeed where others have failed. You must believe that you are, in some critical way, <em><strong>better</strong></em> than the people who preceded you.</p>

<p>And therein lies the problem.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>If You’re Going To Help, Help.</strong></p>

<p>If you’re a founder, don’t be the asshole advice giver. If you’re going to try to help, really try to help. The person on the other side of that conversation will likely have thought about the problem more than you (it’s their job). Do I have strategy and product ideas for RentShare? You BET! But they think about RentShare 31 hours a day.</p>

<p>Founders want to engage other founders in meaningful, thoughtful conversations about their obsession. But it’s painful when someone offers the most obvious of advice and is determined to tell you why your approach — that you’ve carefully crafted over hours, days, months of compulsive, obsessive dedication — is wrong.</p>

<p>So the next time you find yourself talking to another founder and saying, “Hey, you know what you should do?” — think carefully about the next words that come out of your mouth.</p>

<p>Put yourself in her shoes for a second and imagine that she is just as smart and ambitious as you, and that she obsesses about her idea for all of her waking hours, ask yourself if it just might be the beginning of another tired conversation about something she knows about, but is too kind to tell you.</p>

<p>Founders want guidance. Founders need guidance. Founders appreciate guidance. Real, useful guidance requires effort.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s it. One liner. Subject was &#8220;game&#8221;. Not even capitalized. It didn&#8217;t look like spam &#8211; there was no sell, no clear reason why someone would send that message. I assumed it was a mistake, and deleted it without much thought. But &#8220;game&#8221; was in my head. I don&#8217;t even play computer games and I was wondering what game it was.</p>

<p>But its gone now. I&#8217;m back to crushing emails. I am an email slayer. The inbox stands no chance against my efficient email triage process. It never occurred to me that I&#8217;d be giving this brief moment another thought. Then it comes.</p>

<p><strong>8:59 am:</strong> 9 minutes later. Another email pops into my inbox on the same thread:</p>

<blockquote><strong>Subject: </strong>game
<strong>Message:</strong>
is the game called world of tanks?
i will make an account.
what clan are you in?</blockquote>


<p>I could tell by the message, writing, and originating address that it wasn&#8217;t from anyone I knew. In fact, I knew that when I deleted the first email. <strong>I don&#8217;t play computer games. I have never been in a clan. And my interest was piqued.</strong></p>

<p>&#8220;world of tanks&#8221;. I googled it, as I have done at least 3 times in the following week as I&#8217;ve recounted this story to others.</p>

<p><strong>Two phase spam.</strong> This is brilliant. The people who crafted this campaign did so many things right.</p>

<p>The first message is just a hook. Short, enough to flit into your memory and get kicked out. You don&#8217;t even have to open the message in gmail to see the body. It&#8217;s short and the message shows up on the message index!</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t play games. But I <em>like</em> games. Who <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> like games. Just the <em>word</em> game makes me happy. But it&#8217;s gone, out of mind.</p>

<p>First email at 8:50am. Just before the day really starts. Most people haven&#8217;t really started digging into any serious task. A lot of idle email spam deletion. But a lot of people at their inboxes. Doing a lot of nothing. Second email at 9am. Still doing nothing. I google it.</p>

<p>I even click through to the site! I suspect google tracks that people are searching for this and clicking through to the site &#8211; I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if this was somehow helpful to them from an SEO perspective too with google tracking searches for it and clicks to the site.</p>

<p>It was subtle, it was tricky, it gave me just enough information to be curious and it was just unsalesey enough that it could be mistaken for an accident instead of spam.</p>

<p>A lesson in enlightened spamming:</p>

<ol>
    <li>First you plant the seed.</li>
    <li>Then you wait for it to grow into a plant.</li>
    <li>Then you &#8230;</li>
</ol>


<p>You are my spam heroes.</p>

<p><em>Screenshot, for reference:</em>
[A lot of people have commented that I removed the actual email address in plain text but left it in this image.  I removed the email in plain text to prevent it from being scraped by spammers in case the person is real. Spammers generally do not scrape and OCR images, so I have left it in the image. Also, I have contacted the sender multiple times to see if they are a legitimate sender, with no response.]</p>

		<p><strong>What Rocket Lease Does</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.rocketlease.com"><img class=" wp-image-37   alignright" title="Easy Online Rental Applications" src="/images/rl2.png" alt="" width="262" height="137" /></a></p>

<p>My startup, <strong>Rocket Lease</strong>, provides <a href="http://www.rocketlease.com">online apartment applications</a>. If you rent an apartment in the United States, at some point, you&#8217;ll probably fill out a paper application form to give the prospective landlord information like: your name, address, social security number, date of birth, current/previous landlords, net worth, income, etc. as a way to qualify yourself as a good tenant. Your landlord will review this and possibly run a credit check to evaluate your candidacy. This frequently still happens on paper. <a href="http://www.rocketlease.com">Rocket Lease</a> makes it happen online.</p>

<p>I tell you this not to pitch my idea to you. I tell you this to convey how small and unambitious it can sound. And to tell you this is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">deliberate strategic decision</span>.</p>

<p>Focus.</p>

<p><strong>What Rocket Lease Does NOT Do</strong></p>

<p>Now let me tell you about some of the things I DON&#8217;T do:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Help tenants find an apartment</li>
    <li>Help prospective renters choose the best neighborhoods based on nearby bars/restaurants</li>
    <li>Aggregate a list of popular buildings and put out reviews</li>
    <li>Help landlords find qualified leads</li>
    <li>Tell landlords if an applicant will be a good tenant</li>
    <li>Lease signing</li>
    <li>Lead gen for tenant services (move in, move out, maids, painting)</li>
    <li>Process rent payments</li>
    <li>Help roommates share utilities</li>
    <li>Landlord-tenant communication tools</li>
    <li>Landlord financial services (automated tax form generation)</li>
    <li>Maintenance request ticketing system (lead gen for plumbers?)</li>
</ol>


<p>I am not avoiding these because I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re good businesses. They are. By my estimate, almost every single one of these businesses is a $1 billion+ a year market. In fact, I have great friends whose individual startups are tackling some of these other businesses; I hope that some day we&#8217;ll all collaborate.</p>

<p><a title="Rocket Lease" href="http://www.rocketlease.com">Rocket Lease</a> is literally just an alternative to an existing process where information is transmitted between two parties by ink on dead-tree paper. It is an HTML form with some functional candy. But it&#8217;s all I think about and it&#8217;s going to be a damn good HTML form.</p>

<p>Focus.</p>

<p><a href="/images/focus.jpg"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-38" title="Focus" src="/images/focus-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">One awesome thing</span> about startups in the rental space is the abundance of free feedback. Everyone knows someone in the rental space &#8211; an uncle that manages property, your landlord, your friend who is a leasing agent, your friend who has rented a place. As a result, most people have dealt with the hassles and frustrations of renting and they volunteer a lot of great feedback.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">One awful thing</span> about startups in the rental space is &#8230; the abundance of free feedback. Everyone knows someone in the rental space&#8230; so they have a lot of great ideas about how you could make your business WAAAAY better. &#8220;The <em>real</em> pain point for leasing agents is finding apartment seekers. If Rocket Lease would only solve leasing agent lead gen, it&#8217;d be huge. If it&#8217;d only do online rent payments, it&#8217;d tap a 3 trillion dollar market.&#8221;</p>

<p>Focus.</p>

<p>Rocket Lease is as minimal a viable product as I could imagine being useful. I am a landlord. Renting my properties is a pain. There was a time when I had to fax copies of applications to a company in the suburbs of Chicago, and they would fax me back a credit check within 48 hours. This is insane.</p>

<p>The stated goal of Rocket Lease is to make this process suck a little less. The goal is not to make the entire process perfect (yet). Could I do more? You betcha. Will I ever do more? Hopefully. Can I do more now? Not a chance. I can barely keep up as it is.</p>

<p>It would be awesome if Rocket Lease did some of the other things. Sometimes they sound deceptively easy to add on (&#8220;hey you&#8217;re already in the rental space, it&#8217;s just, like&#8230; two more pages&#8230;&#8221;). Each of those deceptively simple add-on ideas has full startups dedicated exclusively to that niche. I can&#8217;t possibly compete with them while dividing my attention.</p>

<p>I love what I&#8217;m doing, and I think it has the potential to help a lot of people and grow into something huge. For that reason it&#8217;s really hard not to get excited about adjacent markets and chase tangents. Some people are good at multi-tasking and managing a bunch of different loops. I am not. For that reason precisely, if I&#8217;m to <em>ever</em> have a shot at doing those other great things, I have to ruthlessly cut them out of my scope today.</p>

<p>Focus.</p>

		<p>I used to be a trader.</p>

<p><img class="alignright" style="color: #333333; font-style: normal; line-height: 24px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; margin-top: 0.4em;" title="Traders" src="/images/CBOT.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="167" /></p>

<p>Traders make more money than I do now. I guess $0 a year is an easy bar to beat.</p>

<div>

Traders like making money. But (broad generalization) while traders like the money, they&#8217;re driven less by money itself than the status and the challenge of creating money.  And this is where today&#8217;s story goes &#8211; Startups are hot. Traders see Facebook, LinkedIn, Groupon, AngiesList, Yelp IPOs and can&#8217;t help but think: &#8220;easy edge&#8221;. And they have the excess capital to fund their pursuits.

<strong>Shameless Self Plug</strong>

<a href="http://rocketlease.com"><img class="size-full wp-image-29" title="Rocket Lease" src="/images/logo2.png" alt="" width="215" height="60" /></a>[/caption]

My little startup, <strong>Rocket Lease</strong>, provides <a href="http://rocketlease.com">online apartment applications and credit checks</a>. It&#8217;s decidedly unsexy. It&#8217;s a tiny bit of the process that helps landlords take applicants and turn them into tenants. It&#8217;s small. I don&#8217;t really know how much money it is going to make, or what the right monetization strategy is, but I&#8217;ll almost certainly charge a small amount on every credit check I run.  So Rocket Lease is going to grind its way to profitability, a couple bucks at a time.  Buy credit checks wholesale, sell them retail. Rocket Lease is 7-11 for credit scores. Yeah, girls swoon upon hearing that.

So my old colleagues often say &#8220;hey ezl, why don&#8217;t you build something like Facebook/Twitter/LinkedIn? The payout is WAAAAY bigger&#8221;. <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3691090">Other smart people</a> have written along these lines too.

Here&#8217;s why.  I&#8217;m not prepared to pay the buy in to play the big startup game.

<strong>Darts</strong>

I play darts (I&#8217;m lying, I don&#8217;t really).

<img class="aligncenter" title="Dartboard" src="/images/283px-Darts_in_a_dartboard.jpg" alt="" width="283" height="188" />

Big startups are a dartboard with a bullseye worth $300mm.  Then sprinkled around the board there are a couple of smaller value sections, $50k, $100k, but the majority of the board is a wasteland of big fat $0 sections.

Small startups are a dartboard where the bullseye might be worth $2mm. and if you miss by a little, it&#8217;s worth $1mm. The rest of the board is comprised of sections that range from $0 to $100k, and while there are $0 sections, the majority of the sections are values greater than $0.  They might not be big numbers, but they&#8217;re non-zero numbers.

The expected value of a random point on the big startup dartboard is $2m (small chance at a lot of money, big chance at nothing). The small startup expected value is $250k (small chance at 2mm, lots of small chances at other payouts). Great. &#8220;small expected value, small variance&#8221; VS. &#8220;big expected value, big variance&#8221;.

Now here&#8217;s the kicker. To play the game, <strong>you have to buy the dartboard</strong>. Price tag?
<ul>
    <li>Big startup dartboard: 2 years of life and $100k in cash.</li>
    <li>Small startup dartboard: 6 months of life and $25k in cash.</li>
</ul>
Where are you now? There&#8217;s no right answer to this. If you&#8217;re 30 and broke and wondering how you&#8217;re going to pay the rent in 6 months, its harder to swing for the fences.  If you sold your last startup so you&#8217;ll never have to worry about food and rent again, big startup board.

<strong>Rocket Lease</strong> is me saying that 40k a year would be life changing for me; and while 200k a year would be better than 40k a year, its not better enough  to warrant the higher buy in and increased probability of getting nothing.

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Twas fun. CM moved there, so we went for Sitges Carnivale (sort of) 2012.</p>

<p>Those guys stay up really late. Didn&#8217;t realize that Barcelona identifies as independent. Reminded me that I&#8217;d like to learn Spanish. And live abroad.  That&#8217;s one of my current biggest regrets.</p>

<p>The trip was really just an excuse to go drinking in Barcelona with CM, JBV, RV, HR.</p>

<p>Things that are great about Barcelona:</p>

<p>Red Solo Cup. CM getting bumped at Sitges. Dicksabers. “Hey guys, can you please make silence.” The best gin and tonics at La Royale. Montiel, best meal of 2012. Tapas 24. Pan con tomate. The realization that Gaudi was almost certainly just always on drugs. When Noelle asked me to guess what she was. Lauren from Hong Kong was awesome.</p>
