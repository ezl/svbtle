	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/founderarrogance/">Founder Arrogance</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A good friend of mine, let’s call him “Christopher Toppino”, who may or may not be working on a really cool startup called <a href="http://rentshare.com">RentShare</a>, that does <a href="http://rentshare.com">online rent payments</a> and expense sharing between roommates, recently received an unsolicited email:</p>

<blockquote><strong>Subject</strong>: (no subject)
<strong>Date</strong>: May 6, 2012 9:17 AM
<strong>Message</strong>:
Hey there.
Fellow entrepreneur here. I heard about your your site in brooklyn mag and had some thoughts.
<ol>
<li>It’s important to be able to bill different amounts to different roommates for example if we go to a bar and order a different number of drinks we shouldn’t pay the same amount.</li>
<li>Credit card processing fees are really high, so nobody will use that for paying rent.</li>
<li>You should expand the product to be able to split expenses among all friends.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>


<p>I happened to be sitting with Chris when he received this email. He didn’t think much of it, but it really got me thinking.</p>

<p><strong>First impression</strong>: Sweet! That’s so cool. Someone wrote you!
<strong>Second impression</strong>: Pop quiz, asshole. How many of those ideas do you think Chris hasn’t thought of?</p>

<p><strong>Ideas</strong></p>

<p>I love talking ideas with people. I love being introduced to new ideas. New ideas often come from other people. There’s no greater compliment than another person volunteering their time and mental energy to something I’ve poured my heart and soul into.</p>

<p>There’s a part of me that jumps with joy whenever someone is so interested in my startup that they spend their valuable time to think about it and give me recommendations/advice.</p>

<p>But sometimes there’s a part of me that cringes because the advice belies an arrogance and presumption of idiocy. And the dividing line between happiness and fury is vanishingly thin.</p>

<p>Part of it is <strong>delivery</strong>. You can do a lot to land on the side away from fury by prefacing a sentence with:</p>

<blockquote>“I’m sure you’ve thought about this way more than me, but…”
“Hmm, I don’t know much about your space, but…”
“There’s probably a good reason why you’re not doing this already…”</blockquote>


<p>These are really transparent, but effective ways that you can soften statements. Sort of like the startup founders’ advice equivalent of:</p>

<blockquote>“I don’t want to sound like a jerk, but… [proceed to say jerk thing]“</blockquote>


<p>No doubt, part of the knee-jerk rejection response is <strong>fear that I’ve have missed something</strong> incredibly obvious that some stranger will be able to call to my attention. It’s really easy to get caught up in your own world, and an outside perspective can do wonders to put things into perspective.</p>

<p>However, the biggest component that determines my response is <strong>how much thought went into the advice</strong>. If the advice is from another founder and is just scratching the surface, it’s almost an insult — “Oh hey, i’ve thought about this for 2 seconds, and I have the brilliant insight that is going to make your startup finally succeed.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Founders Are ________.</strong></p>

<p>Startup founders are<strong> smart and ambitious</strong>. They create things, often from nothing. They are building empires and fortunes out of their sheer creative genius.</p>

<p>Startup founders are <strong>problem solvers</strong>. They see broken things around us, inefficiencies in the system, and they want to make it better, easier, faster, cheaper.</p>

<p>And startup founders are <strong>arrogant</strong>. As a founder, you need a deep conviction that your project is going to be a success. And odds are good that someone has done something similar before you, so you’re implicitly asserting that you can succeed where others have failed. You must believe that you are, in some critical way, <em><strong>better</strong></em> than the people who preceded you.</p>

<p>And therein lies the problem.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>If You’re Going To Help, Help.</strong></p>

<p>If you’re a founder, don’t be the asshole advice giver. If you’re going to try to help, really try to help. The person on the other side of that conversation will likely have thought about the problem more than you (it’s their job). Do I have strategy and product ideas for RentShare? You BET! But they think about RentShare 31 hours a day.</p>

<p>Founders want to engage other founders in meaningful, thoughtful conversations about their obsession. But it’s painful when someone offers the most obvious of advice and is determined to tell you why your approach — that you’ve carefully crafted over hours, days, months of compulsive, obsessive dedication — is wrong.</p>

<p>So the next time you find yourself talking to another founder and saying, “Hey, you know what you should do?” — think carefully about the next words that come out of your mouth.</p>

<p>Put yourself in her shoes for a second and imagine that she is just as smart and ambitious as you, and that she obsesses about her idea for all of her waking hours, ask yourself if it just might be the beginning of another tired conversation about something she knows about, but is too kind to tell you.</p>

<p>Founders want guidance. Founders need guidance. Founders appreciate guidance. Real, useful guidance requires effort.</p>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/my-favorite-spammers-world-of-tanks/">My Favorite Spammers: World of Tanks</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Last week I got some clever spam.  It was the first time I have ever been impressed by a spammer.  I don&#8217;t know how widespread this technique is, but it got me to act, and I usually ruthlessly delete spam.</p>

<p><strong>8:50 am:</strong> I get an email from [obscured]@comcast.net. Someone I don&#8217;t know. Almost certainly spam. None of my friends use @comcast.net email addresses. None of the people who are still my friends anyways (sorry guys, 2012 new years resolution). The email is simple:</p>

<blockquote><strong>Subject: </strong>game
<strong>Message:</strong>
I think i found the game you are talking about.</blockquote>


<p>That&#8217;s it. One liner. Subject was &#8220;game&#8221;. Not even capitalized. It didn&#8217;t look like spam &#8211; there was no sell, no clear reason why someone would send that message. I assumed it was a mistake, and deleted it without much thought. But &#8220;game&#8221; was in my head. I don&#8217;t even play computer games and I was wondering what game it was.</p>

<p>But its gone now. I&#8217;m back to crushing emails. I am an email slayer. The inbox stands no chance against my efficient email triage process. It never occurred to me that I&#8217;d be giving this brief moment another thought. Then it comes.</p>

<p><strong>8:59 am:</strong> 9 minutes later. Another email pops into my inbox on the same thread:</p>

<blockquote><strong>Subject: </strong>game
<strong>Message:</strong>
is the game called world of tanks?
i will make an account.
what clan are you in?</blockquote>


<p>I could tell by the message, writing, and originating address that it wasn&#8217;t from anyone I knew. In fact, I knew that when I deleted the first email. <strong>I don&#8217;t play computer games. I have never been in a clan. And my interest was piqued.</strong></p>

<p>&#8220;world of tanks&#8221;. I googled it, as I have done at least 3 times in the following week as I&#8217;ve recounted this story to others.</p>

<p><strong>Two phase spam.</strong> This is brilliant. The people who crafted this campaign did so many things right.</p>

<p>The first message is just a hook. Short, enough to flit into your memory and get kicked out. You don&#8217;t even have to open the message in gmail to see the body. It&#8217;s short and the message shows up on the message index!</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t play games. But I <em>like</em> games. Who <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> like games. Just the <em>word</em> game makes me happy. But it&#8217;s gone, out of mind.</p>

<p>First email at 8:50am. Just before the day really starts. Most people haven&#8217;t really started digging into any serious task. A lot of idle email spam deletion. But a lot of people at their inboxes. Doing a lot of nothing. Second email at 9am. Still doing nothing. I google it.</p>

<p>I even click through to the site! I suspect google tracks that people are searching for this and clicking through to the site &#8211; I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if this was somehow helpful to them from an SEO perspective too with google tracking searches for it and clicks to the site.</p>

<p>It was subtle, it was tricky, it gave me just enough information to be curious and it was just unsalesey enough that it could be mistaken for an accident instead of spam.</p>

<p><a href="http://ezliu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/sethrogen.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-53" title="sethrogen" src="http://ezliu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/sethrogen-243x300.jpg" alt="" width="243" height="300" /></a></p>

<p>A lesson in enlightened spamming:</p>

<ol>
    <li>First you plant the seed.</li>
    <li>Then you wait for it to grow into a plant.</li>
    <li>Then you &#8230;</li>
</ol>


<p>You are my spam heroes.</p>

<p><em>Screenshot, for reference:</em>
[A lot of people have commented that I removed the actual email address in plain text but left it in this image.  I removed the email in plain text to prevent it from being scraped by spammers in case the person is real. Spammers generally do not scrape and OCR images, so I have left it in the image. Also, I have contacted the sender multiple times to see if they are a legitimate sender, with no response.]</p>

		<p><strong>What Rocket Lease Does</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.rocketlease.com"><img class=" wp-image-37   alignright" title="Easy Online Rental Applications" src="http://ezliu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/rl2.png" alt="" width="262" height="137" /></a></p>

<p>My startup, <strong>Rocket Lease</strong>, provides <a href="http://www.rocketlease.com">online apartment applications</a>. If you rent an apartment in the United States, at some point, you&#8217;ll probably fill out a paper application form to give the prospective landlord information like: your name, address, social security number, date of birth, current/previous landlords, net worth, income, etc. as a way to qualify yourself as a good tenant. Your landlord will review this and possibly run a credit check to evaluate your candidacy. This frequently still happens on paper. <a href="http://www.rocketlease.com">Rocket Lease</a> makes it happen online.</p>

<p>I tell you this not to pitch my idea to you. I tell you this to convey how small and unambitious it can sound. And to tell you this is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">deliberate strategic decision</span>.</p>

<p>Focus.</p>

<p><strong>What Rocket Lease Does NOT Do</strong></p>

<p>Now let me tell you about some of the things I DON&#8217;T do:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Help tenants find an apartment</li>
    <li>Help prospective renters choose the best neighborhoods based on nearby bars/restaurants</li>
    <li>Aggregate a list of popular buildings and put out reviews</li>
    <li>Help landlords find qualified leads</li>
    <li>Tell landlords if an applicant will be a good tenant</li>
    <li>Lease signing</li>
    <li>Lead gen for tenant services (move in, move out, maids, painting)</li>
    <li>Process rent payments</li>
    <li>Help roommates share utilities</li>
    <li>Landlord-tenant communication tools</li>
    <li>Landlord financial services (automated tax form generation)</li>
    <li>Maintenance request ticketing system (lead gen for plumbers?)</li>
</ol>


<p>I am not avoiding these because I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re good businesses. They are. By my estimate, almost every single one of these businesses is a $1 billion+ a year market. In fact, I have great friends whose individual startups are tackling some of these other businesses; I hope that some day we&#8217;ll all collaborate.</p>

<p><a title="Rocket Lease" href="http://www.rocketlease.com">Rocket Lease</a> is literally just an alternative to an existing process where information is transmitted between two parties by ink on dead-tree paper. It is an HTML form with some functional candy. But it&#8217;s all I think about and it&#8217;s going to be a damn good HTML form.</p>

<p>Focus.</p>

<p><a href="http://ezliu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/focus.jpg"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-38" title="Focus" src="http://ezliu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/focus-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">One awesome thing</span> about startups in the rental space is the abundance of free feedback. Everyone knows someone in the rental space &#8211; an uncle that manages property, your landlord, your friend who is a leasing agent, your friend who has rented a place. As a result, most people have dealt with the hassles and frustrations of renting and they volunteer a lot of great feedback.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">One awful thing</span> about startups in the rental space is &#8230; the abundance of free feedback. Everyone knows someone in the rental space&#8230; so they have a lot of great ideas about how you could make your business WAAAAY better. &#8220;The <em>real</em> pain point for leasing agents is finding apartment seekers. If Rocket Lease would only solve leasing agent lead gen, it&#8217;d be huge. If it&#8217;d only do online rent payments, it&#8217;d tap a 3 trillion dollar market.&#8221;</p>

<p>Focus.</p>

<p>Rocket Lease is as minimal a viable product as I could imagine being useful. I am a landlord. Renting my properties is a pain. There was a time when I had to fax copies of applications to a company in the suburbs of Chicago, and they would fax me back a credit check within 48 hours. This is insane.</p>

<p>The stated goal of Rocket Lease is to make this process suck a little less. The goal is not to make the entire process perfect (yet). Could I do more? You betcha. Will I ever do more? Hopefully. Can I do more now? Not a chance. I can barely keep up as it is.</p>

<p>It would be awesome if Rocket Lease did some of the other things. Sometimes they sound deceptively easy to add on (&#8220;hey you&#8217;re already in the rental space, it&#8217;s just, like&#8230; two more pages&#8230;&#8221;). Each of those deceptively simple add-on ideas has full startups dedicated exclusively to that niche. I can&#8217;t possibly compete with them while dividing my attention.</p>

<p>I love what I&#8217;m doing, and I think it has the potential to help a lot of people and grow into something huge. For that reason it&#8217;s really hard not to get excited about adjacent markets and chase tangents. Some people are good at multi-tasking and managing a bunch of different loops. I am not. For that reason precisely, if I&#8217;m to <em>ever</em> have a shot at doing those other great things, I have to ruthlessly cut them out of my scope today.</p>

<p>Focus.</p>

<p><a href="http://ezliu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Zen04.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-39" title="Focus" src="http://ezliu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Zen04-300x217.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="217" /></a></p>

		<p>I used to be a trader.</p>

<p><img class="alignright" style="color: #333333; font-style: normal; line-height: 24px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; margin-top: 0.4em;" title="Traders" src="http://thetradingzone.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/CBOT.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="167" /></p>

<p>Traders make more money than I do now. I guess $0 a year is an easy bar to beat.</p>

<div>

Traders like making money. But (broad generalization) while traders like the money, they&#8217;re driven less by money itself than the status and the challenge of creating money.  And this is where today&#8217;s story goes &#8211; Startups are hot. Traders see Facebook, LinkedIn, Groupon, AngiesList, Yelp IPOs and can&#8217;t help but think: &#8220;easy edge&#8221;. And they have the excess capital to fund their pursuits.

<strong>Shameless Self Plug</strong>

[caption id=&#8221;attachment_29&#8221; align=&#8221;alignright&#8221; width=&#8221;215&#8221; caption=&#8221;Online Apartment Applications&#8221;]<a href="http://rocketlease.com"><img class="size-full wp-image-29" title="Rocket Lease" src="http://ezliu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/logo2.png" alt="" width="215" height="60" /></a>[/caption]

My little startup, <strong>Rocket Lease</strong>, provides <a href="http://rocketlease.com">online apartment applications and credit checks</a>. It&#8217;s decidedly unsexy. It&#8217;s a tiny bit of the process that helps landlords take applicants and turn them into tenants. It&#8217;s small. I don&#8217;t really know how much money it is going to make, or what the right monetization strategy is, but I&#8217;ll almost certainly charge a small amount on every credit check I run.  So Rocket Lease is going to grind its way to profitability, a couple bucks at a time.  Buy credit checks wholesale, sell them retail. Rocket Lease is 7-11 for credit scores. Yeah, girls swoon upon hearing that.

So my old colleagues often say &#8220;hey ezl, why don&#8217;t you build something like Facebook/Twitter/LinkedIn? The payout is WAAAAY bigger&#8221;. <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3691090">Other smart people</a> have written along these lines too.

Here&#8217;s why.  I&#8217;m not prepared to pay the buy in to play the big startup game.

<strong>Darts</strong>

I play darts (I&#8217;m lying, I don&#8217;t really).

<img class="aligncenter" title="Dartboard" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Darts_in_a_dartboard.jpg/283px-Darts_in_a_dartboard.jpg" alt="" width="283" height="188" />

Big startups are a dartboard with a bullseye worth $300mm.  Then sprinkled around the board there are a couple of smaller value sections, $50k, $100k, but the majority of the board is a wasteland of big fat $0 sections.

Small startups are a dartboard where the bullseye might be worth $2mm. and if you miss by a little, it&#8217;s worth $1mm. The rest of the board is comprised of sections that range from $0 to $100k, and while there are $0 sections, the majority of the sections are values greater than $0.  They might not be big numbers, but they&#8217;re non-zero numbers.

The expected value of a random point on the big startup dartboard is $2m (small chance at a lot of money, big chance at nothing). The small startup expected value is $250k (small chance at 2mm, lots of small chances at other payouts). Great. &#8220;small expected value, small variance&#8221; VS. &#8220;big expected value, big variance&#8221;.

Now here&#8217;s the kicker. To play the game, <strong>you have to buy the dartboard</strong>. Price tag?
<ul>
    <li>Big startup dartboard: 2 years of life and $100k in cash.</li>
    <li>Small startup dartboard: 6 months of life and $25k in cash.</li>
</ul>
Where are you now? There&#8217;s no right answer to this. If you&#8217;re 30 and broke and wondering how you&#8217;re going to pay the rent in 6 months, its harder to swing for the fences.  If you sold your last startup so you&#8217;ll never have to worry about food and rent again, big startup board.

<strong>Rocket Lease</strong> is me saying that 40k a year would be life changing for me; and while 200k a year would be better than 40k a year, its not better enough  to warrant the higher buy in and increased probability of getting nothing.

		<p>Twas fun. CM moved there, so we went for Sitges Carnivale (sort of) 2012.</p>

<p>Those guys stay up really late. Didn&#8217;t realize that Barcelona identifies as independent. Reminded me that I&#8217;d like to learn Spanish. And live abroad.  That&#8217;s one of my current biggest regrets.</p>

<p>The trip was really just an excuse to go drinking in Barcelona with CM, JBV, RV, HR.</p>

<p>Things that are great about Barcelona:</p>

<p>Red Solo Cup. CM getting bumped at Sitges. Dicksabers. “Hey guys, can you please make silence.” The best gin and tonics at La Royale. Montiel, best meal of 2012. Tapas 24. Pan con tomate. The realization that Gaudi was almost certainly just always on drugs. When Noelle asked me to guess what she was. Lauren from Hong Kong was awesome.</p>

		<p>A startup friend of mine wrote me this today:</p>


<blockquote class="gmail_quote">You don&#8217;t strike me as someone who wishes to partner with people for your projects, but rather would like to be knowledgable enough to staff with the right people, and that definitely seems right for your approach to mid-sized initial targets.</blockquote>


<p>I ended up writing a pretty long response to it, and I&#8217;m reproducing it here:</p>


<p>There&#8217;s a lot of truth to this, but it&#8217;s not really an aversion to partnerships; that behavior is more of a symptom of my underlying approach to startups.</p>


<p><strong>A few bold claims:</strong></p>


<ol><li>Startups are &#8220;sexy&#8221; &#8212; Everyone wants to be involved in startups</li>
<li>Most people like the idea of startups more than startups &#8212; they don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re doing, and they don&#8217;t have staying power, </li>
<li>Partnerships can be fragile and broken partnerships sink startups</li>
</ol>


<p>I generally err on the side of being trusting to strangers, but I am quite protective of equity. Usually, if I feel like I can learn enough to know who to trust to do &#8220;commodity&#8221; work, I like the clarity of a deal where I can say &#8220;you do X, you get Y&#8221;.</p>


<p><strong>Partnerships often fall apart because there&#8217;s an implicit, unspoken agreement</strong> like &#8220;we&#8217;re going to bust our butts and then we&#8217;ll both be rich so who cares divide the pie in 2&#8221;.  But then life happens and [&#8220;my dog died&#8221;, &#8220;i got engaged&#8221;, &#8220;i moved to washington&#8221;, &#8220;i ran out of money and had to get a job&#8221;].  <strong>When founders aren&#8217;t equally yoked in a supposedly equal partnership, tensions arise </strong>(&#8220;I&#8217;m doing 80% of the work and getting 50% of the pie!&#8221;) and unfortunately this scenario is startlingly common.  Founders have to find the right combination of expectation, desire, vision, needs in life, skill contribution &#8212; not that they have to be the same, but they have to fit well.</p>


<p>So yes, <strong>I probably seem partner-averse on the outside, but what I really am is always trying to preserve/grow expected value</strong>.  Every transaction I engage in is (hopefully) a step in this direction.  Try to <strong>extract the greatest gain for the lowest cost</strong>.  A lot of times that cost is cash or helping someone out for a favor in return, but there are _absolutely_ times when partnerships are the best value option.</p>


<p><strong>Partnering with weak partners is value destroying</strong> (for the original value holder) and unfortunately, the frothiness of startups makes it generally easy to find weak partners and hard to find strong ones. But I like meeting people and you never know where value is going to come from, so I always like to keep an open mind.</p>


<p>However, there does exist a &#8220;right&#8221; type of partner. Partners aren&#8217;t just about some skill they bring to the table, like &#8220;awesome developer&#8221; or &#8220;best sales guy ever&#8221; but what they draw out of you &#8220;he makes me think critically about problems&#8221; (whatever <strong>the nerd version of &#8220;You complete me&#8221;</strong> is&#8230;).  Great partners should be 1+1= 56 for each other. <strong>In a great relationship, each person should think of him/herself as the weak link.</strong></p>


<p><span>If you can&#8217;t figure out what each person brings to the table that the other(s) need and can&#8217;t otherwise easily get, you&#8217;re overpaying for partners. </span>I want to walk away from interactions with my partners thinking, <span>&#8220;Oh crap I&#8217;m in waaaay over my head&#8221;.  For me that&#8217;s a really clear sign that someone is a value creating partner. </span><span>Then I have to start worrying about whether I bring anything to the table.</span></p>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/death-of-a-startup-spaciety-post-mortem/">Death of a Startup: Spaciety Post-mortem</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<h2>Background</h2>


<p>For those in catchup mode, until recently I was working on a startup called Spaciety (Pronounced: SPA-siety, like combining the words SPA &amp; soCIETY. That seemed really clever until we realized nobody could figure it out.  Startup rule #1: Avoid pronunciation ambiguity).</p>


<p><span>Spaciety is dead and we killed it</span>.  AAD, JBV, and I all invested a lot of effort into Spaciety, and we ultimately folded.</p>


<p><span><strong>Spaciety is Open Table or Expedia for spas and salons. We made it easy for customers to search for and book beauty services online</strong>.</span>  I&#8217;ll save most of the sales pitch for below, but spas and salons are a $100+ billion industry that is very fragmented and poorly served by technology.  It&#8217;s a very exciting space and someone will come make a killing, but it won&#8217;t be us.</p>


<p>Startup death is part of the game, and we knew we&#8217;d have to quit if it was a dud. The hard part was killing it when we might have had something good.</p>


<h2>Why Spaciety was / is great</h2>


<p><strong>Spaciety had over 100 partner spas listing services on the website at the time we made the decision to shut it down.  Spas love the idea.</strong></p>


<p>The spa industry as a whole has a vacancy rate somewhere north of 40%.  This poses a problem for spas since their &#8220;inventory&#8221; effectively self-destructs every hour.  If you have no massage bookings today, you can&#8217;t just book twice as many massages tomorrow to cover the loss.  As a result, spas are actually quite eager to sign up with a service that helps them book off-peak hours, even at substantial discounts.</p>


<p>The real value was in providing <span><strong>variable, occupancy-based pricing</strong> model</span> that allowed spas to keep peak hours at standard rates, but progressively lower rates for off-peak hours (fancytalk for &#8220;as spa owners get more desperate&#8221;). Remember: one minute before 2pm on a Wednesday, the spa has effectively agreed to accept $0 revenue for each unbooked appointment. Spaciety sold the ability to reach an audience willing to pay more than $0 at the last minute, and that was a powerful thing.</p>


<p>This is contrary to Groupon&#8217;s or Living Social&#8217;s model where spas offer large discounts, but those coupons often go towards filling up peak hours when the spa would have been booked anyways. This hurts spa owners because they accept less revenue where they would normally make money to cover down times.  There are so many daily deal sites offering spa services that these dealhunters rarely come back and there is very little positive impact in off-peak booking rates.</p>


<p>Basically, <strong>spas wanted to use it &amp; customers were ecstatic</strong> about being able to book online.</p>


<h2>Then Spaciety said &#8220;Let there be online booking&#8221;, and there was online booking</h2>


<p>Unfortunately, I can&#8217;t claim credit for the initial build &#8212; the <strong>real stars are AAD and JBV</strong>. They were very proactive, talked to spa owners, got feedback, collaborated closely with a <a href="http://pybrew.com" target="_blank">crack team of developers</a> to build a working solution, and got the business off the ground.  They pounded pavement, called spas, <strong>flirted with spa owners</strong> (both  female and male&#8230; it was ugly&#8230;), and otherwise did whatever they had to do to sign people up.</p>


<p>I was treading water on my own startup at the time and they were minting revenue in the first week of launch. I certainly eyed their success with envy.</p>


<p>For my friends who aren&#8217;t startup people: <strong>the idea always sounds easy</strong>, but execution&#8217;s a bitch. Web startups don&#8217;t cost money to build, they cost blood, sweat, and tears. <strong>Making that first dollar is damn near impossible</strong>.  Mad props, gents.  AAD and JBV rose to the challenge and then some.  When they later invited me to officially join the team, I could not have felt more honored.</p>


<h2>Fatal flaw</h2>


<p>After the crushingly successful launch, there was an experimentation period where we tried various strategies to grow.  There&#8217;s a myth that startups follow some sort of exponential growth path (It&#8217;s just that &#8212; a myth).  The trajectory for Spaciety was more like a series of plateaus.  We took a very methodical approach to testing and measuring new strategies for growth, but we kept flatlining.  Despite this, we continued to grow both the consumer and spa sides of the business until it became clear that we would have problems scaling the business in its current form.</p>


<p>The <strong>initial plan for Spaciety was to tightly integrate with each spa&#8217;s appointment booking software</strong> and algorithmically determine optimal pricing for each appointment.  What we found was that there is no universal schedling software, or even a clear market leader.  Most booking systems don&#8217;t have easy ways to extract the data, the market is highly fragmented, there&#8217;s no dominant technology, no standard data format, adoption is highly regional, and the systems are old &#8212; &#8220;built in the early 90s&#8221; old (techsnob speak for &#8220;unusable/ancient&#8221;).</p>


<p>As an alternative, Spaciety worked with individual spas to determine what appointments were generally unbooked from week to week and listed those appointments on the site. <span><strong>Whenever an appointment was booked online, our automated system would call the spa to confirm availability</strong></span> (&#8220;If this appointment is available, press 1; if not, press 9&#8221;). The Spaciety site inventory represented a <strong>highly probable, but not guaranteed inventory</strong>, as determined based on the historical bookings of a particular spa.</p>


<p>As a result, there was<span> always some <strong>chance that a customer would book an appointment and it would be unavailable</strong></span>.  To mitigate this issue, we 1) concentrated on acquiring multiple spas in close proximity so we could direct overflow to nearby partner spas, 2) made sure spas were aware of this so they would try to be flexible squeezing in appointments for us.</p>


<p>This worked well for a while, but somewhere around 85 partner spas, AAD started spending an inordinate amount of time/effort dealing with unavailable appointments.  <strong>85 spas worth of listings, each with a small chance of being unavailable added up to a big chance of problems on any given day</strong>.  Dealing with these collisions takes more time than you&#8217;d think, and the fear that it could happen at any time worried us constantly.</p>


<p><strong>As we continued to grow, it was clear that this strategy was unsustainable.</strong></p>


<h2>Darkness</h2>


<p>It&#8217;s really frustrating to work hard, get something to start working, and only then realize that you&#8217;re tanked. </p>


<p>Imagine standing at the bottom of a deep well with fog overhead. You can&#8217;t see the top. There are 20 ladders going up, but you can&#8217;t see how high they go.  We had just climbed one of the ladders and found out that it stopped dead 30 feet up.</p>


<p>When you climb back down and look around at the other 19 ladders around you, not knowing (1) how high each will take you, or (2) <em><strong>if any of them even get to the top</strong></em>, it&#8217;s scary.  <strong>It&#8217;s demoralizing</strong>.  And we were somewhere around ladder #5 by this point.</p>


<h2>Light</h2>


<p>It was clear to us that we needed to bite the bullet and <strong>explore full integration with all the Spa Scheduling Software Systems</strong> (S4, yeah thats right, I just made up that acronym).  What we found that was that there were way <span>too many systems and almost all of them were outdated</span>.</p>


<p>We had 2 options:</p>


<ol><li><strong>Building and maintaining X packages</strong> to integrate with all the software systems</li>
<li><strong>Building our own scheduling system </strong>and defining and publishing a standard for the industry to use for appointment information (hotel industry has something similar)</li>
</ol>


<p>We quickly eliminated Option A &#8212; we didn&#8217;t want to go from &#8220;guys who are revolutionizing the spa industry&#8221; to &#8220;guys who maintain 50 different software integration modules and whose software breaks anytime an independent vendor changes their code&#8221;. And it sounded boring.</p>


<p>Option B is surprisingly compelling.  The idea was that we could <strong>leverage our existing trust with in-network spas</strong> to develop better software (we&#8217;re good at developing good software, fast) and <strong>immediately have it in a large number of spas</strong>.</p>


<p>We spoke with a lot of people about this and we settled on <span>building and <strong>distributing the software for free, then using it as a funnel for taking transaction fees</strong> on online bookings</span>.  &#8221;Owning&#8221; the centralized source of all appointment data is wildly valuable for all sorts of reasons.</p>


<p>Additionally, investors who were already interested in us really perked up because building the software and owning the data gave us<strong> defensible IP and increased barriers to entry</strong> for direct competitors.  We already understood the market, had the trust of spa owners, and know how to build next generation software.</p>


<p>We accidentally stumbled upon <strong>something investors liked more</strong>.  We flirted with funds. Contacts from our old finance careers were asking to give us money.  We literally just had to sign on the dotted line to get funding.</p>


<p>One problem: <strong>It&#8217;s a long game</strong>.  Even if we got into 100 spas today, we needed to get into 5,000 spas.  Building good software isn&#8217;t enough for that. <strong>We&#8217;d be committing to building and selling for 2 years to even find out if we had a fighting shot</strong>.</p>


<p>In the end, <span>it was another ladder into the fog</span>. We didn&#8217;t want to risk ending at the top of a really high ladder in 2 years.  If we had started this path 2 years ago, I might be writing a different story. But our lives had changed in the last 2 years (AAD, congrats on the new baby!) and the risk/reward profile of the new path no longer fit our current desires.  </p>


<p>The work would be long, the path uncertain, and the payout questionable.  Those are always true, but we were looking for something that was either more likely, less difficult, or testable on a shorter time horizon. The business profile just wasn&#8217;t right for us.</p>


<h2>Founder-startup fit</h2>


<p>Startup people spend a lot of time talking about &#8220;product-market fit&#8221;, meaning &#8220;do you have a product the market wants?&#8221; But sometimes the product-market fit is right, but the founders don&#8217;t fit the startup. When I was 23 with $475 rent, I would have run for a 2% chance at 100mm, but old man me prefers a 50% chance at 3mm. Spaciety died because the business model it forced wasn&#8217;t right for us.</p>


<p>I wonder how many startups die because of founder-startup fit. Or how many founders don&#8217;t recognize the lack of founder-startup fit and ride a trajectory to failure. The truth is, I think AAD and I were blessed with great mentors and friends; we were lucky to be able to assess the lack of fit and make the hard, but rational call to shut it down.</p>


<p>Like all stories, there&#8217;s more complexity to this one, but if you want to hear about it you&#8217;ll have to sit the 3 of us down for a drink. On you. Preferably something very expensive.</p>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/what-the-heck-ive-been-doing-since-i-quit-my-job/">What the Heck I&#8217;ve Been Doing Since I Quit My Job</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><strong>Quitting Comfort</strong></p>


<p>A while back, I left a cushy options trading job to work on startups.  For me, &#8220;startups&#8221; meant &#8220;websites that make money&#8221;.  The fantasy was that:</p>


<ol><li>income from an online job would let me travel freely and stop setting morning alarm clocks; and</li>
<li>I would work less </li>
</ol>


<p>How&#8217;d I do? 1. I wildly underestimated how hard it was going to be to make real income online, though I&#8217;ve been fortunate enough to travel a bit. 2. I totally missed the mark on working less. I &#8220;work&#8221; 10x more than I did; in retrospect, though, i don&#8217;t see how I could have worked less than I did at CTC.</p>


<p>There have been times when I&#8217;ve doubted the decision, but for now I&#8217;m happy with it.  Though I work much longer hours, I&#8217;m not forced to live by someone else&#8217;s schedule and I generally find the work engaging.</p>


<p>It&#8217;s funny how it so much easier it is to stomach the long hours and hard work as long as its self inflicted.  The hardest part about being your own boss is the realization that your boss is an asshole that makes you work long hours and pays you nothing.  For me, the win is less about waking up late than the knowledge that i CAN wake up late. Hopefully one day I&#8217;ll exercise that privilege.</p>


<p><strong>Spaciety&#160;: Online Booking for Spas &amp; Salons</strong></p>


<p><img align="left" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lykiikODOo1r6ben5.png" /></p>


<p>Most recently, I spent 3 months with AAD in Cincinnati at a startup incubator called <a href="http://brandery.org/">The Brandery</a>, working on <strong><a href="http://spaciety.com">Spaciety</a>, a website to provide online booking for spas and salons</strong>.  For the people I haven&#8217;t talked to in a while, there are a lot of &#8220;startup incubators&#8221; around the country.  In return for a small equity stake in your startup, they typically give you cash, business coaching, and help you make valuable contacts for 3 months, and put you in front of a lot of investors.  </p>


<p>Spaciety was making a little money, and though AAD and I were confident we could raise financing, the project wasn&#8217;t a good fit for us and our immediate goals, so we pulled the plug shortly after the start of 2012.</p>


<p>No regrets about shutting it down &#8212; I&#8217;m glad I got to work with AAD closely for the duration and we met a lot of great people in Cincinnati.  We really needed that 3 months to give the idea a fair shake and we learned a lot.</p>


<p><strong>Leasely?&#160;: Online Rental Applications and Tenant Screening</strong></p>


<p><img align="left" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lykijgj7in1r6ben5.png" /></p>


<p>Now I&#8217;ve shifted my primary focus to reviving <strong><a href="http://leasely.com">Leasely</a>, online rental applications and tenant screening </strong>&#8212; Leasely is an old startup idea I was working on with rz and wc, but life got in the way and we started working on other things.  That site is not maintained and its incomplete; hopefully a new version of it will be available soon.  The name will probably change as well, so if you have recommendations, I&#8217;d love to hear them.</p>


<p>I&#8217;m really excited about working on Leasely.  When rz, wc, and I were initially working on it, I felt pretty strongly that it was the best idea I had worked on.  It seems ridiculous that the majority of apartment applications today still use a paper application form.</p>


<p>I&#8217;m hopeful that 2012 will finally bring some measure of startup success.</p>
