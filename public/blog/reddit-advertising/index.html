	<h1 class="title">Reddit 'Advertising'</h1>
	<div class="entry-content"><p>Ever since I read about the success of Duck Duck Go&#8217;s Reddit advertising campaign, I wanted to experiment a bit with advertising on Reddit.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve tried a few approaches on <a href="/blog/currently-paying-150-per-conversion/" title="Paying 150 Per Conversion For Rocket Lease">Google Adwords</a> and <a href="/blog/getting-started-with-linked-in-ads/" title="Linked In Advertising Starter Guide">Linked</a> <a href="/blog/linked-in-ads-results-3-days/">In</a> without a lot of success (though I&#8217;ll probably try again soon, as I think I&#8217;ve learned a lot since early trials).</p>

<p>With Google, I tried the traditional keyword approach, targeting keywords that are indicative of interest in Rocket Lease&#8217;s services (online rental applications).  With Linked In, the goal was to target decision makers at real estate companies who might not be actively looking for a solution but seemed like probable Rocket Lease users.</p>

<h2>Approach</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.rocketlease.com/reddit/"><img src="/images/reddit_ad.png" alt="Rocket Lease Reddit advertising" /></a></p>

<p>With Reddit, I tried an entirely different approach.  Instead of looking for users, I wanted to appeal to Redditors to help me spread the word.  I assumed that most redditors aren&#8217;t landlords but almost all redditors know someone is a landlord or rents from a landlord.</p>

<p>This particular appeal was a personal request for readers to share the word.  Redditors on the internet.  They probably largely prefer doing this online.  I hoped that Redditors might be willing to spread the word. I wasn&#8217;t asking for signups or money or even a lot of time &#8211; just to share the word for a process that I think they might prefer for the next time they or someone they know rents an apartment.</p>

<p>User time is really valuable as well, so I wanted to make it as easy as possible for users to share. The <a href="http://www.rocketlease.com/reddit/">reddit landing page</a> was modeled after <a href="http://500px.com/terms">500px&#8217;s excellent terms of service page</a> that has the cliff notes version alongside the actual text for easy reading.  Additionally, I tried to make it easy for users to invite landlords with a built-in form and one click twitter and facebook sharing.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rocketlease.com/reddit/"><img src="/images/redditeasyshare.png" alt="Easy Social Media Sharing" /></a></p>

<p>I advertised in the Real Estate subreddit &#8211; I was the only advertiser in this category, so that means that my was displayed at the top of the page for any user browsing the subreddit directly and I also showed up on the main feed for any logged in users who subscribe to that subreddit.</p>

<p>I also spent the minimum amount advertising to the main page, which gives me exposure proportionate to the amount of money I spent ($20/day, the minimum) compared to other advertisers who were advertising on the same day.  This pool is MUCH bigger, but also generally has people who probably care less about Rocket Lease.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>Mostly underwhelming.</p>

<p>Over 3 days:</p>

<ul>
<li>Total cost: $150</li>
<li>503,248 impressions</li>
<li>398 clicks</li>
<li>0.079% CTR</li>
<li>6 landlord invitations</li>
<li>1.25 pages per visit (whee, 20 % of visitors probably hit the landing page, site average is 4.5 pages/visit)</li>
<li>89% bounce rate (substantially higher than my normal, but expected for redditors, site average is 45%)</li>
<li>average visit duration 37 seconds (eh not surprised, but I was hopeful for more, site average is 4:30 seconds/visit)</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="/images/reddit_results_full.png"><img src="/images/reddit_results_graph.png" alt="Results" /></a></p>

<p>5 of the landlord invitations occured on the first day, and 1 on the second day. &#8216;Twas cool that you can see Reddit traffic patterns in the impressions.</p>

<h2>What I Should Have Done Differently</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Test different headlines</strong>  In general, I need to start split testing more things on Rocket Lease.</li>
<li><strong>Run the campaign for longer</strong> I&#8217;m conflicted on this.  On the one hand, the 3 day traffic pattern was declining and I got all my results in the first 24 hours. CTR appeared to be generally decreasing as well over time, so that makes me think users just decided they didn&#8217;t care and everyone who was going to do anything did it in the first 24 hours. However, I suspect there&#8217;s some value in remaining as a persistent feature on the page to really sink into readers&#8217; subconscious.  By now, its doubtful that any redditor even remembers that campaign occured at all.  For 1000 bucks, I can stay at the top of the reddit real estate section for an entire month and change the headlines over time.</li>
</ul>
