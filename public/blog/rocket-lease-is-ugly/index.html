	<div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://rocketlease.com">Rocket Lease</a> is pretty ugly.  There I said it.</p>

<p>I know it&#8217;s not the prettiest, and my position until recently has been &#8220;Oh well, but it&#8217;s functional&#8221;, and that matters way more than &#8220;beautiful&#8221;.  Besides, existing players in the market don&#8217;t have gorgeous UI&#8217;s so it&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m losing.</p>

<p>I started checking out the &#8220;Visitors Flow&#8221; section in my Google Analytics today.  I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m reading it right, but from what I can tell, Visitors Flow seems like a poor man&#8217;s funnel analysis, without having done any of the work up front to set it up.  Which is great, because I haven&#8217;t set anything up!</p>

<p>The unfortunate part is that, I&#8217;m getting a ~2.2% signup rate.  I&#8217;m not sure if its that my messaging is unclear or that my site is too ugly, but I&#8217;ve heard (and agree with feedback) that the site is uninviting.  (Also don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s good or bad or if I can do better or who&#8217;s coming to my site, but that&#8217;s something to figure out later&#8230;)</p>

<p>Anyways, all the feedback that my site is ugly and that the &#8220;borrowed&#8221; stock image is terrible has finally sunk in, so I&#8217;m in the process of getting a new landing page ready to test, thanks to my good friend Justin K.  A preview of the landing page (don&#8217;t mind the Lease Rocket / Rocket Lease, Justin was just being playful with that):</p>

<p><a href="/images/photo.jpg"><img src="/images/photo-923x1024.jpg" alt="" title="New Landing Page Mockup" width="450" height="499" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-193" /></a></p>

<p>Simultaneously, Ryan G is working with me to rethink the internal UI and make it clearer to new users what they need to do. Ryan&#8217;s a brilliant UI/UX guy and has really helped me narrow down the screens to the bare essentials, helped make the process more fun, and taught me a ton about UI/UX on the way. The new Rocket Lease dashboard and applications will be much slicker, more inviting to users, and easier to understand.  Can&#8217;t wait to get this stuff live.</p>

<p>Very excited to see if this stuff performs differently and to be able to have something pretty to show off.</p>
