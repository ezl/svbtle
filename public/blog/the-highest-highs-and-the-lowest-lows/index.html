Really high highs and really low lows&#8230; such is startup life&#8230;</p>

<p>Pretty crazy week for <a href="http://www.rocketlease.com">Rocket Lease</a>.  I don&#8217;t expect startup life to be easy, but its been a bit of a rollercoaster and I&#8217;m exhausted.</p>

<p>In the span of 48 hours, we&#8217;ve been evicted from our insanely gorgeous office space, had our best 2 days of business ever, gotten our credit reports (our core product) shut off by our vendor, and gotten 4 amazing interns.</p>

<h2>Highlights</h2>


<p><strong>Best office space ever:</strong> Rocket Lease has been sharing extra office space with an insanely awesome startup, KM, who has probably the most insanely gorgeous office space I&#8217;ve seen to date.  They gave us an unbeatable deal in the spirit of founders helping founders / startups helping startups. Unbelievable space. Just have to post some pics to brag&#8230;</p>

<p><a href="http://ezliu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/2012-06-12-11.17.31.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-224" title="2012-06-12 11.17.31" src="http://ezliu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/2012-06-12-11.17.31-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><a href="http://ezliu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/2012-06-12-11.17.57.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-225" title="2012-06-12 11.17.57" src="http://ezliu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/2012-06-12-11.17.57-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><a href="http://ezliu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/2012-06-12-11.18.26.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-226" title="2012-06-12 11.18.26" src="http://ezliu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/2012-06-12-11.18.26-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Amazing team and interns:</strong> We currently have 2 full timers (me + Mike) and 4 college interns (Alec, Alper, Jason, John). Mike did a phenomenal job getting really sharp, smart, entrepreneurial interns who really connect with the project, and I am/was looking forward to an awesome summer.  Anyways, team of 6. This is an important point.</p>

<p>When too much is going right, you almost have to expect something to go wrong in startup land&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Credit report malfunction!!</strong> Due to a communication error with our credit vendor, Rocket Lease&#8217;s credit reports were turned off for almost 2 days. Those 2 days happened to be the highest 2-day application submission volume we&#8217;ve had to date (13 applications, not a big deal in the grand scheme, but a big deal to me!).</p>

<p>When the issue was finally resolved with the credit vendor, I breathed a sigh of relief, because it was super stressful to be getting paying customers that we couldn&#8217;t serve.</p>

<p><strong>Evicted!!</strong> Within an hour of the credit issue resolution, KM&#8217;s landlords asked them to &#8220;remove any non-KM people from the space&#8221;. Uh oh. Trouble in paradise. Now we have a team of 6 and we&#8217;re evicted. Homeless team of 6 is a problem because its definitely too big for us to be using starbucks as the office now&#8230;</p>

<h2>*Sigh*</h2>


<p>So it goes. The good news is that the interns are still very upbeat and are rolling with the punches.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d still like to try to see if there&#8217;s a chance we can strike a deal where the landlord will be cool with us staying, but I haven&#8217;t been able to connect with them, so I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;m getting ignored.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m really committed to making sure the interns extract a lot of value out of this relationship, so I want to make sure we&#8217;re in a stable place, but now I&#8217;m scrambling to find space.  I have a couple of leads, but I don&#8217;t want to pull in favors that will end up being too costly for me in the long run, so I&#8217;m treading lightly.</p>

<p>If anyone can temporarily house 6 of us for a week or two while we try to get our feet on the ground, there will be much karma returned.</p>
