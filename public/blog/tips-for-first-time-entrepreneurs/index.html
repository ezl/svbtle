	<div class="entry-content"><p>Last year, I taught a class at <a href="http://www.generalassemb.ly">General Assembly</a>
called &#8221;<a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/3192487817">How To Start A Startup If You&#8217;re Not A Developer</a>&#8221;
where I focused on helping aspiring non-technical founders
get from the idea stage to an MVP.</p>

<p>Since then, I&#8217;ve taught several variations of that course.  As a result,
I&#8217;ve had the privilege of connecting with many aspiring founders, both developers
and non-developers.</p>

<p>What follows is some unsolicited advice for first-time entrepreneurs.</p>

<h3>&#8220;Bad&#8221; Ideas != Failures</h3>

<p>Smart people often make the jump from &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t use it&#8221; to &#8220;that won&#8217;t be economically viable&#8221;.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, that terrible restaurant down the street has been in business for 20 years and
people continue to pay $10 (or $200 dollars) a month for Wordpress, which is open source.</p>

<p>There are customers other than you that will make the businesses you hate thrive.</p>

<h3>&#8220;Good&#8221; Ideas != Profitable Ideas</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s a mistake to assume that because an idea is sensible it will make money.</p>

<ol>
<li>You&#8217;re not &#8220;everyone other than you&#8221;. You don&#8217;t know how they think. What is sensible to you might not be sensible to them.</li>
<li>People rarely adopt/switch technologies for economically rational reasons alone.</li>
</ol>


<h3>You Probably Need Less Tech Than You Think</h3>

<p>Most ideas can be validated and even sold to customers before much product
development is ever done.  Try to build less.</p>

<h3>Getting Traction Is Harder Than You Think</h3>

<p>Even if your idea is great, your product is great, and your customers love it;
expect the path to traction to be long, tedious, frustrating, and painful.</p>

<p>I love Dropbox. It&#8217;s awesome. My friends were giving rave reviews. It made sense
to me intellectually. I installed it at least 3 times and didn&#8217;t <em>really</em> start
using it for at least 12 months after I first installed it.  I still don&#8217;t
pay for it.</p>

<p>Your product is probably less awesome than Dropbox.</p>

<p>Getting traction will require <a href="http://startupschool.org/2012/rusenko/">steely resolve</a>, lots of hard work, and more time
than you want to give (or a ton of luck).</p>

<hr>


<p>Most of these really boil down to this: You aren&#8217;t &#8220;everyone else&#8221;. It&#8217;s arrogant to
presume that you can predict what millions of other people
are going to like, think, and do.</p>
