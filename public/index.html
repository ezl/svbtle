		<h2>Are Emily and Brendan More Employable than Lakisha and Jamal?</h2>

<p>Issues of race and sex intrigue me.</p>

<p>Americans are very sensitive about discrimination (moreso than anywhere else in the world), it is generally taboo, and I believe Americans often bend over backwards to hide overt signs of racism and sexism in favor of subtle, but equally pernicious displays of masked discrimination.</p>

<p>I had heard of a well cited study (<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-201_162-575685.html">1</a>, <a href="http://www.nber.org/digest/sep03/w9873.html">2</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagobooth.edu/capideas/spring03/racialbias.html">3</a> <a href="http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/marianne.bertrand/research/papers/emily_lakisha_aer.pdf">Original research</a>) indicating that employers respond more favorably to white names than black names. The study states that white names received 50% more responses than black names after sending out 5000 resumes.</p>

<p><strong>Question: How can I use societal prejudices to aid in startup success?</strong></p>

<h2>Race for Internet Marketing and Startups</h2>

<p>Imagine you intend to send an email to a prospective contact (PR, media, inquiring customer, totally unsolicited spam, whatever). You want the best possible response rate (opening your email, completing your survey). What if you could impact that just by controlling the &#8220;from&#8221; field on your outgoing email?</p>

<p>The implications of disparities in perceptions of race and gender extend beyond email marketing. How can you stack the odds in your favor for any human interaction?</p>

<p>Who should make your sales calls? Who should be the face of your company on TV? Do you need a <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-10-05/women-help-startups-succeed-dot-when-will-vcs-notice">woman as your CEO</a>? Startup success is hard earned, founders should take every advantage they can.</p>

<div class="note">
<p>One founder I know has a &#8220;hot girl networking strategy&#8221;.</p>
<p>The basic idea is that if he wants to get in touch with an investor outside of his network, the best way to make that happen is through a warm intro from a portfolio company. He gets a hot girl to make the initial contact to a male founder in a portfolio company. If they connect to a male founder who gets excited by connecting with a hot girl, he might get the intro he wants.</p>
</div>


<h2>Experiment &amp; Findings</h2>

<p>I emailed around 1000000 people selling items on online classifieds sites from email addresses popularly associated with a specific race, then measured response rates for each race.</p>

<p>White names performed 11.9% better than black names (expected qualitative result, but less than the 50% disparity reported by the study)</p>

<p>Hipanic names performed 4.9% better than white names (surprising, statistically significant with 99.9% confidence)</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>race</th><th>response rate</th></tr>
</thead>
<tr><td>black</td><td>11.01%</td></tr>
<tr><td>white</td><td>12.32%</td></tr>
<tr><td>hispanic</td><td>12.92%</td></tr>
</table>


<h2>Discussion</h2>

<p>I was unsurprised to find white names outperformed black names. I found it surprising that hispanic names outperformed both white and black names.</p>

<p><strong>White names outperformed black names by only 11.9% compared to the 50% in the employment study. Why?</strong></p>

<ol>
    <li>Different recipients - the original employer study targeted people making hiring decisions, this data targeted people selling things online.
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>business owners/HR departments might be more racist,</li>
            <li>business owners/HR departments might have a different racial profile (is there a higher percentage of white small business owners than white &#8220;selling things online&#8221; people?),</li>
            <li>online sellers of goods might not care who they are selling to, they just want to move goods</li>
        </ol>
    </li>

    <li>Competing responses - in the original study, 4 resumes were sent to each employer, 2 white resumes and 2 black resumes. In our study, each recipient received only one inquiry and global response rates were measured. As such, the original study&#8217;s resumes were in competition with one another.  If a white resume were selected, it could eliminate the possibility of response for a black resume, therefore exacerbating the disparity measured as a result of any racial bias.</li>
</ol>


<p><strong>Hispanic names outperformed white names.</strong></p>

<p>This was unexpected.  I expected whites to perform the best, but I had no evidence or knowledge of other studies to indicate that this ought to be the case.</p>

<p>The results measure the response rates from people who post items for sale on online classified ad sites. It would be interesting to see the racial breakdown for this posting population.</p>

<h2>Why I Did This</h2>

<p>My last startup, <a href="http://blog.ezliu.com/blog/death-of-a-startup-spaciety-post-mortem/">Spaciety</a>, targeted a predominantly female population.</p>

<p>Like many startups, we wanted press and blog writeups. My cofounder AAD and I very unscientifically tested the effects of reaching out to blogs and spas using the same email, but from either one of our email accounts, or from the email account of a female intern.  In our unscientific, statistically insignificant exploration, we thought that the female sender garnered a much higher response rate.</p>

<p>I hoped to find evidence that a specific sender profile could help me get better response rates and media writeups.</p>

<p>We also collected data on open rates, gender, other races, posting section, subject lines and email body content.</p>

<h2>Method</h2>

<p>This section is boring, I encourage you to skip it.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create lists of names likely to be associated with only one race. To do so:<br />
<ol style="list-style-type:upper-roman;">
<li>Find publicly available lists of the most common given names by race.</li>
<li>Find publicly available lists of the most common surnames by race.</li>
<li>Remove any names that appear on more than one list.</li>
</ol>
<p>This leaves a list of surnames and given names that appear with high frequency in populations that have self-identified as belonging to a particular race.</p>

<li>Find email addresses in &#8220;items for sale&#8221; section of online classifieds websites.</li>
<li>For each such email address, randomly assign a &#8220;from&#8221; address on the email from a pool of names that occur with high frequency in either black, white, or hispanic children&#8217;s names.</li>
<li>Email each address inquiring about the item for sale, originating from an email address with a name generated from a given name and surname from one of the lists as described above.</li>
<div class="note">
<p>For example, when emailing someone to inquire about an item for sale, randomly select between a black, white, or hispanic sender (say a random 3 sided die chose &#8220;hispanic&#8221;). Randomly select a given name from the hispanic given name list (&#8220;Antonio&#8221;). Randomly select a surname from the hispanic surname list (&#8220;Banderas&#8221;). Send an email from &#8220;Antonio Banderas&#8221; antonio.banderas@example.com.</p>
</div>
<li>For each email sent, embed a pixel to track open rates, and measure response rates by sender race.</li>
</ol>

    <article class="post">
	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/founder-failure-insurance-follow-up/">Founder Failure Insurance: Follow Up</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I got a few interested queries when I wrote first about <a href="/blog/founder-equity-pool/">Founder Failure Insurance</a> and I&#8217;ve thought about it a bit more since then.</p>

<p>Today I received a short and sweet email from TV:</p>

<blockquote><p>Interesting premise.  Not saying I would contribute but would love to hear more about it.</p></blockquote>

<p>Naturally, I thought it would be sensible to ramble endlessly in response. Here&#8217;s what I wrote:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Twas really mostly an idea at a bar amongst friends.</p>

<p>I think there&#8217;s a lot of sense in it, its essentially portfolio diversification.  As a single founder you&#8217;re just investing 100% in your own stock and nobody else&#8217;s.  You&#8217;re constrained to one industry, one vertical, and one implementation.  You are basically ALL variance.</p>

<p>Ideally, as a founder, you should feel like you&#8217;re working on the best stock, so in a sense, trading any of your company for other companies might be a negative expected value play &#8211; however, by picking partner/portfolio companies effectively you decrease your return variance. Pick your poison.</p>

<p>Realistically, even though you should think your idea is the best, you should also hopefully accept that your idea <em>might not</em> be the best, the highest EV, or the most likely to succeed.  Then a founder&#8217;s insurance fund makes total sense.</p>

<p>Of course, you can&#8217;t just throw equity willy nilly into a pool of losers equity.  In the ideal case for any individual founder, they are the dog of the pool.  You want to put 5% into a pool with the next Stripe, Airbnb, Heroku, and Dropbox.  Of course, they want the same.  So you&#8217;ll have to find a situation where you&#8217;re equally yoked.  You need to have something they want, and they need to have something you want.</p>

<p>There are a couple of obvious flavors of this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Industry diversification:</strong> I&#8217;m in real estate. I think mobile is hot. Someone else is doing a more stable consumer play.  An enterprise person. Different profiles of returns with different difficulties, but essentially betting on other founders to rock it in their field.  Each founders is effectively investing into a hand chosen seed fund thats trying to hedge its bets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Industry saturation:</strong> Well shit, There will definitely be an open table competitor that crushes open table.  There are probably 50 companies that are trying. Three person shops that have decent idea but might not make it. One, or a few of these companies will make a run at it, maybe merge, and emerge victorious.  You all have a shot.  Equity in a pool early on ensures that (a) you guys are incentivized to share and help each other out, improving all of your odds, (b) if your company isn&#8217;t the winner, you still get to participate on the rewards.  Basically, you know you picked the right sector, but how do you know if you&#8217;ve picked the right name? This lets you eliminate the idiosyncratic risk (in the extreme where ALL the viable startups in a space are pooled).</p></li>
</ol>


<p>In practice, you&#8217;ll end up finding like minded people. If you get in a group of founders thats too good for you, they won&#8217;t want your equity. If you&#8217;re too good for them, you won&#8217;t want their equity.  Everyone wants to imagine that they&#8217;re the best founder.  You&#8217;ll probably just have to be different enough that your the best in at least one dimension that makes you desirable to the others.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve had a few interesting conversations with founders.  The biggest hurdle to this right now is distribution.  If we were to find 10 founders that were interested, that wouldn&#8217;t be enough because we&#8217;d need to subclass that group into equally good/likely/viable startups/founders.  We need 100s of founders to jump into a dating pool and select each other.</p></blockquote>

<p>If you think there&#8217;s anything interesting about this idea, the best thing you can do is help me spread it.</p>

		<p>If you&#8217;re working on a startup or freelancing, you often find yourself frequenting cafes around town. If you&#8217;re like me, you try to stay away from Starbucks.</p>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/founder-equity-pool/">Founder Equity Pool / Founder Failure Insurance</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>My startup is unlikely to succeed. Your startup is unlikely to succeed.</p>

<p>Does anyone want to throw a couple points of equity into a pool to hedge their bets? I like to think of this as &#8220;founder failure insurance&#8221;.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: I have no idea what the legal ramifications of this are, and the details are definitely tricky.  Critics will almost certainly say &#8220;this is impossible legally&#8221; and/or &#8220;this would never work in practice&#8221;.</p>

<p>I know that <em>I</em> personally, for <a href="http://www.rocketlease.com">Rocket Lease</a> would be interested in hedging my success in a portfolio with other founders.</p>

<h2>How It Works</h2>

<p>I don&#8217;t know how it works. I know that a naive flavor of this, in its simplest form, looks something like:</p>

<div class="note">
<p>10 founders get together, donate 3% of their respective companies to a pool in return for 10% of the returns of the portfolio.</p>

<p>Then maybe something like 7 founders fail, 1 breaks even, 1 gets acquired, and 1 makes a real run for the big bucks.  The ones that failed end up making a little back since they&#8217;re part of the pool. The big winner gives up a little of the company returns, but hopefully he&#8217;s not a greedy bastard and he is still happy that he paid a little insurance in case he was one of the failures.</p>
</div>


<p>Ideally if your startup succeeds, you get disproportionately large returns and you&#8217;re so rich anyway you don&#8217;t remember what piddling amounts like 3% of your company were.</p>

<h2>Gotchas</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Voting</strong> &#8211; As a group, you&#8217;d want to invest in only good bets (insurance companies don&#8217;t like insuring risky people either).  However, great founders and great ideas fail too, sometimes for reasons outside their control. The group probably can&#8217;t just let companies in willy nilly, because bad founders would be incentivized to join the pool, contribute equity that becomes ultimately worthless, and reap the rewards of others. Some quorum would probably have to vote in new members.</li>
<li><strong>Failure</strong> &#8211; what happens with failures? The entire point of the pool is to make something even when you fail.</li>
<li><strong>Dilution</strong> &#8211; I imagine that founders probably just give x% of the equity when joining the fund and it just gets diluted out with future investment and such.  Can&#8217;t do anything special here because we don&#8217;t want the pool to penalize the companies chances of success (investors who don&#8217;t like ugly cap tables or weird preferred shares)</li>
<li><strong>Variable Contribution/Buy-In</strong> &#8211; maybe some founders only want to give up 1% and another founder wants to donate 10%. Should unequal contributions be allowed? Or just tell everybody they&#8217;re in for 3% in return for an equal share of the resulting portfolio? If variable contributions are allowed, the pool quorum has to determine what amount of the prospective portfolio company they want in return</li>
<li><strong>Buying Out / Quitting</strong> &#8211; Buying out your poriton of the pool? Is this legit? The pool doesn&#8217;t want the next Heroku&#8217;s founders to buy out their shares right before they know they&#8217;re going to get bought.  At the same time, we don&#8217;t want high performing companies to get penalized with the addition of a lot of garbage companies.</li>
<li><strong>Management Fee</strong> &#8211; Legal isn&#8217;t cheap. Give an attorney 30 basis points to keep him happy? And does the fund need a manager? Obviously as a participant, I want it to be as cheap as possible for myself, but I&#8217;d also love to not be the one in charge of managing this.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Why I want to do this</h2>

<p>I think this would be a fun idea, but I don&#8217;t know if its feasible or what the details would have to look like. If you are a critic, please tell me why it sucks (and preferably, how it can be workable). If you are interested, please tell me so we can start scheming. <a href="mailto:ericzliu@gmail.com">Email me.</a></p>

<p>One cool thing about this is that it also gives participants a pool of other (hopefully high quality) founders that they are personally invested in seeing succeed. Participants might also see interesting dealflow from other early stage startups.</p>

<p>There doesn&#8217;t have to be just one of these.  Any group of founder friends who is interested in equity swapping can do so, with their own private agreements.</p>

<p>This is the result of a conversation a few nights ago at 25 degrees with CG and CQ. I had previously also spoken with JF at the Brandery about this.  All have expressed some interest in exploring this, so might already have a few people in on this.</p>

<p><a style="color:#D20606; font-size:1.5em; text-decoration:underline;" href="mailto:ericzliu@gmail.com">Join in on the fun</a></p>

    <article class="post">
	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/reddit-advertising/">Reddit &#8216;Advertising&#8217;</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Ever since I read about the success of Duck Duck Go&#8217;s Reddit advertising campaign, I wanted to experiment a bit with advertising on Reddit.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve tried a few approaches on <a href="/blog/currently-paying-150-per-conversion/" title="Paying 150 Per Conversion For Rocket Lease">Google Adwords</a> and <a href="/blog/getting-started-with-linked-in-ads/" title="Linked In Advertising Starter Guide">Linked</a> <a href="/blog/linked-in-ads-results-3-days/">In</a> without a lot of success (though I&#8217;ll probably try again soon, as I think I&#8217;ve learned a lot since early trials).</p>

<p>With Google, I tried the traditional keyword approach, targeting keywords that are indicative of interest in Rocket Lease&#8217;s services (online rental applications).  With Linked In, the goal was to target decision makers at real estate companies who might not be actively looking for a solution but seemed like probable Rocket Lease users.</p>

<h2>Approach</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.rocketlease.com/reddit/"><img src="/images/reddit_ad.png" alt="Rocket Lease Reddit advertising" /></a></p>

<p>With Reddit, I tried an entirely different approach.  Instead of looking for users, I wanted to appeal to Redditors to help me spread the word.  I assumed that most redditors aren&#8217;t landlords but almost all redditors know someone is a landlord or rents from a landlord.</p>

<p>This particular appeal was a personal request for readers to share the word.  Redditors on the internet.  They probably largely prefer doing this online.  I hoped that Redditors might be willing to spread the word. I wasn&#8217;t asking for signups or money or even a lot of time &#8211; just to share the word for a process that I think they might prefer for the next time they or someone they know rents an apartment.</p>

<p>User time is really valuable as well, so I wanted to make it as easy as possible for users to share. The <a href="http://www.rocketlease.com/reddit/">reddit landing page</a> was modeled after <a href="http://500px.com/terms">500px&#8217;s excellent terms of service page</a> that has the cliff notes version alongside the actual text for easy reading.  Additionally, I tried to make it easy for users to invite landlords with a built-in form and one click twitter and facebook sharing.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rocketlease.com/reddit/"><img src="/images/redditeasyshare.png" alt="Easy Social Media Sharing" /></a></p>

<p>I advertised in the Real Estate subreddit &#8211; I was the only advertiser in this category, so that means that my was displayed at the top of the page for any user browsing the subreddit directly and I also showed up on the main feed for any logged in users who subscribe to that subreddit.</p>

<p>I also spent the minimum amount advertising to the main page, which gives me exposure proportionate to the amount of money I spent ($20/day, the minimum) compared to other advertisers who were advertising on the same day.  This pool is MUCH bigger, but also generally has people who probably care less about Rocket Lease.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>Mostly underwhelming.</p>

<p>Over 3 days:</p>

<ul>
<li>Total cost: $150</li>
<li>503,248 impressions</li>
<li>398 clicks</li>
<li>0.079% CTR</li>
<li>6 landlord invitations</li>
<li>1.25 pages per visit (whee, 20 % of visitors probably hit the landing page, site average is 4.5 pages/visit)</li>
<li>89% bounce rate (substantially higher than my normal, but expected for redditors, site average is 45%)</li>
<li>average visit duration 37 seconds (eh not surprised, but I was hopeful for more, site average is 4:30 seconds/visit)</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="/images/reddit_results_full.png"><img src="/images/reddit_results_graph.png" alt="Results" /></a></p>

<p>5 of the landlord invitations occured on the first day, and 1 on the second day. &#8216;Twas cool that you can see Reddit traffic patterns in the impressions.</p>

<p>See the <a href="/images/reddit_results_full.png">full hourly breakdown of the campaign</a></p>

<h2>What I Should Have Done Differently</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Test different headlines</strong>  In general, I need to start split testing more things on Rocket Lease.</li>
<li><strong>Run the campaign for longer</strong> I&#8217;m conflicted on this.  On the one hand, the 3 day traffic pattern was declining and I got all my results in the first 24 hours. CTR appeared to be generally decreasing as well over time, so that makes me think users just decided they didn&#8217;t care and everyone who was going to do anything did it in the first 24 hours. However, I suspect there&#8217;s some value in remaining as a persistent feature on the page to really sink into readers&#8217; subconscious.  By now, its doubtful that any redditor even remembers that campaign occured at all.  For 1000 bucks, I can stay at the top of the reddit real estate section for an entire month and change the headlines over time.</li>
</ul>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2012-west-coast-road-trip-3-weeks-2070-miles/">2012 West Coast Road Trip: 3 Weeks, 2070 Miles</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&#8217;ve been slacking from my weekly writing date with my blog because Google tells me that my site has been compromised. I keep saying I&#8217;ll fix it then resume my writing, but that hasn&#8217;t happened, so for now, I&#8217;m writing on a domain that has been compromised. I think that really just means I need to fix some .htaccess files, but that&#8217;s a job for another day.</p>

<p>August 2012, Seattle to San Diego. 3 weeks, 2070 miles, 5 Crossfit boxes, every Whole Foods along the way.</p>

<p>The places we stopped for at least one night:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Seattle, WA</li>
    <li>Seaview, WA</li>
    <li>Portland, OR</li>
    <li>Crater Lake National Park</li>
    <li>Redding, CA</li>
    <li>San Francisco, CA</li>
    <li>Sonoma, CA</li>
    <li>Carmel/Monterey, CA</li>
    <li>Buellton, CA</li>
    <li>Los Angeles, CA</li>
    <li>San Diego, CA</li>
</ol>


<p>First decided I wanted to do this trip more than 3 years ago (probably right when A and B were getting married &#8211; thought I might be able to hit the wedding on the way).  Well, 3 years later, thanks to M, we finally got it done.  Twas awesome.  Thought we were going to get bored and not have enough to do, but on the contrary, we ran out of things to do really fast. Didn&#8217;t spend more than 2 nights anywhere and didn&#8217;t get to do too much in most cities.  Lots of great scenery, good food, meeting old friends, relaxing away from real life. &#8216;Twas awesome.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been pooh-poohing the west coast for a long time now, and now I realize my folly. West Coast &gt;&gt;&gt; NYC. hands down.</p>

<p>Highlights:</p>

<ul>
    <li>I think I love Seattle. I keep getting lucky and every time I go, its sunny and beautiful. I&#8217;m afraid if I move there it&#8217;ll be dreary and foggy like everyone says it is, but I&#8217;ve never experienced. Seattle food was shockingly good. Salumi is overrated. Ma&#8217;ono was excellent.</li>
    <li>Steamboat Inn near Crater Lake National Park. Tiny adorable hotel on the Umpqua River where there is no cell phone reception or internet. Local Oregon wines</li>
    <li>Ashland, OR &#8211; we passed through the Shakespeare Festival but didn&#8217;t go. Cute town, would like to actually stop there next time.</li>
    <li>Very cool vintage RV rally at the Sou&#8217;wester Inn &amp; Lodge/RV park. I still want to live in an Airstream trailer. Sorry, M.</li>
    <li>Portland is adorable. I feel like I&#8217;d get bored of it quickly though. Salt and Straw is great. Would like to try more food trucks. And wtf, it IS where young people retire. All the spots we wanted to go to were packed on a Monday afternoon.</li>
    <li>TChung, great catching up.</li>
    <li>House was not as good as I remembered it from 7 years ago. Restaurants and palates change in 7 years, so I wasn&#8217;t particularly surprised. Still good to find out for sure.</li>
    <li>Roli Roti is awesome. The Ferry Building is awesome. I love the abundance of Asian stuff in SF, but I don&#8217;t know if I love it enough to want to live there.</li>
    <li>I was most looking forward to Monterey/Carmel to remind me of my time at music camp down there, but the fog really ruined it. How did I get the most perfect summer ever when I went before?</li>
    <li>TCho, you too. Love the bitters idea. Great to see you&#8217;re rocking it, CH. Chego was great.</li>
    <li>Fuck LA traffic.</li>
    <li>I like having water in my life. Looking out over that big vast blue, whether ocean or lake, brings me inner peace.</li>
    <li>San Diego &#8211; Also wasn&#8217;t a big winner for weather, I guess we got unlucky. I don&#8217;t care about zoos.  Love the idea of being able to have a house on the beach and have night time campfires. However, I didn&#8217;t get the feeling that I&#8217;d love the food or people.  Angriest drivers we met on the whole road trip.</li>
</ul>


<p>2070  miles for 3 states. If we had driven 2 more hours in each direction or circled around less internally, we could have hit 3 <em>countries</em>.</p>

<p>My first real vacation in a few years, but I did still do some &#8220;work&#8221;.  At some point I&#8217;d like to do a sans-computer/electronics/phone/email 4+ week vacation. One day when I&#8217;ve made it.</p>
