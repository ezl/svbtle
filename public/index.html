	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/tips-for-first-time-entrepreneurs/">Tips for First Time Entrepreneurs</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Last year, I taught a class at <a href="http://www.generalassemb.ly">General Assembly</a>
called &#8221;<a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/3192487817">How To Start A Startup If You&#8217;re Not A Developer</a>&#8221;
where I focused on helping aspiring non-technical founders
get from the idea stage to an MVP.</p>

<p>Since then, I&#8217;ve taught several variations of that course.  As a result,
I&#8217;ve had the privilege of connecting with many aspiring founders, both developers
and non-developers.</p>

<p>What follows is some unsolicited advice for first-time entrepreneurs.</p>

<h3>&#8220;Good&#8221; Ideas != Profitable Ideas</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s a mistake to assume that because an idea is sensible it will make money.</p>

<ol>
<li>You&#8217;re not &#8220;everyone other than you&#8221;. You don&#8217;t know how they think. What is sensible to you might not be sensible to them.</li>
<li>People rarely adopt/switch technologies for economically rational reasons alone.</li>
</ol>


<h3>&#8220;Bad&#8221; Ideas != Failures</h3>

<p>Smart people often make the jump from &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t use it&#8221; to &#8220;that won&#8217;t be economically viable&#8221;.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, that terrible restaurant down the street has been in business for 20 years and
people continue to pay $10 (or $200 dollars) a month for Wordpress, which is open source.</p>

<p>There are customers other than you that will make the businesses you hate thrive.</p>

<h3>You Probably Need Less Tech Than You Think</h3>

<p>Most ideas can be validated and even sold to customers before much product
development is ever done.  Try to build less.</p>

<h3>Getting Traction Is Harder Than You Think</h3>

<p>Even if your idea is great, your product is great, and your customers love it;
expect the path to traction to be long, tedious, frustrating, and painful.</p>

<p>I love Dropbox. It&#8217;s awesome. My friends were giving rave reviews. It made sense
to me intellectually. I installed it at least 3 times and didn&#8217;t <em>really</em> start
using it for at least 12 months after I first installed it.  I still don&#8217;t
pay for it.</p>

<p>Your product is probably less awesome than Dropbox.</p>

<p>Getting traction will require <a href="http://startupschool.org/2012/rusenko/">steely resolve</a>, lots of hard work, and more time
than you want to give (or a ton of luck).</p>

<hr>


<p>Most of these really boil down to this: You aren&#8217;t &#8220;everyone else&#8221;. It&#8217;s arrogant to
presume that you can predict what millions of other people
are going to like, think, and do.</p>

    <article class="post">
	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/create-value/">Create Value</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>One lie that I&#8217;m consantly told is <em>&#8220;Early stage startups only need developers&#8221;</em>.</p>

<p>It typically comes in the context of <em>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how to program, but I want
to work for a startup. Unfortunately, early stage startups only need coders.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>This is (a) <strong>false</strong>, and (b) <strong>an excuse</strong>.</p>

<h3>What Do Startups Need?</h3>

<p>Startups are a quest to make valuable things from ideas and sweat.  <strong>Early stage
startups need people who create value.</strong></p>

<p>While writing code is an easy way to feel like you&#8217;re creating value, it&#8217;s far from
the only way to create value.  If you can&#8217;t code:</p>

<ul>
<li>Get customers / letters of intent</li>
<li>Make cold calls</li>
<li>Get lunch and coffee and dry cleaning for the developers so they can get the MVP out the door faster</li>
<li>Optimize adwords campaigns</li>
<li>Build buzz via social media</li>
<li>Get bloggers to write about you / do PR</li>
<li>Run focus groups</li>
<li>Find free office space for a team by calling other startups in the area and asking if any of them will host you.</li>
</ul>


<h3>How To Get A Job At Any Startup</h3>

<p><strong>You can get a job at ANY early stage startup by emailing the founder and telling him you&#8217;ll create value for his/her team.</strong>  Here&#8217;s a template:</p>

<blockquote>
Hi, my name is [name].<br>

I want to work for your startup, for free. I&#8217;m not a developer. I am smart,
hardworking, motivated, and a quick learner.<br><br>

I know you may not have a budget for a non-technical team member now, so I&#8217;d
like to intern at your company for no pay for 3 weeks. During that time, I
will do anything and everything to create value for your team.<br><br>

This costs you nothing. If at any time, you can&#8217;t justify keeping me around,
we will both agree to amicably part ways and I will be grateful for the
experience. No expectations.<br><br>

Could I show up on Tuesday of next week to get started? We can consider it an interview. If it seems like a fit, I&#8217;ll just get
started with seeing how I can add value to the team. If I don&#8217;t hear an explicit &#8220;no&#8221; from you,
I&#8217;ll see you on Tuesday!
</blockquote>


<p>Then you have 3 weeks to make yourself absolutely indispensible to that company.</p>

<h3>Why This Will Work?</h3>

<p>Here&#8217;s a secret about startup founders: They like money. So if you can join
their team for free and make them richer, they&#8217;ll be excited about paying you
to stick around. (Another hint: if they <em>don&#8217;t</em> want free value creation, they
probably suck or it&#8217;s not a fit)</p>

<p>If you CAN&#8217;T make yourself unquestionably indispensible in some way, then
you need to ask yourself whether you&#8217;re really adding enough value for the
startup to consider hiring you.</p>

<p>The next time someone tells you that code is the most important thing, consider this:</p>

<p>It is <em>sometimes</em> possible to outsource code. It is <em>never</em> possible to
outsource strategy or business development.</p>

    <article class="post">
	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/idea-hustler-school/">Idea: Hustler School</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Non-technical people frequently approach me to build them an MVP. &#8221;<em>Why should
I work with you?</em>&#8221;, I ask. &#8221;<em>Because I&#8217;m a great hustler</em>&#8221;, they respond.</p>

<p>A lot of these people claim to have access to capital, connections,
tons of domain expertise, or whatever. Basically, there are a lot of great
hustlers in the making, but they don&#8217;t have a track record and can&#8217;t prove
that they are good hustlers.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to invert the typical &#8220;incubator&#8221; process. Applicants pay money,
buy into a company, get an MVP, and hustle.</p>

<p>First time hustlers, this is where I tell you to put your money where your
mouth is. Stop saying &#8220;if only i had product, i&#8217;d be an awesome hustler&#8221;</p>

<p>For $5,000, you get half of the company (an MVP), and operate as the CEO for
3 months. We will agree upon guidelines for success/failure metrics and if
you are the hustler you claim to be, you&#8217;ll win big.</p>

<p>If you fail, you&#8217;ll be forced to either recognize that you&#8217;re not the hustler
you thought you were or explain how/why you failed.</p>

<p>New hustlers <strong>wildly</strong> underestimate the amount of effort it takes to get
traction, how much unglamorous grunt work there is, and don&#8217;t have a good
idea of how to methodically test approaches to traction.  Many new hustlers
are also often attracted to the glamour of startups but are pretty lazy when
it&#8217;s not just sitting around and talking ideas.</p>

<p>The hustler&#8217;s job is to take a mutually agreed upon idea (probably an MVP of my
choosing), and get traction.</p>

<p>The hustler pays $5k, gets a functioning MVP (that he/she agrees to work on),
options for 50% of the company, then hustles:</p>

<ul>
<li>write blog posts</li>
<li>seo that sucker</li>
<li>create landing pages</li>
<li>cold call</li>
<li>pass out flyers</li>
<li>do logistics for our new food delivery service</li>
<li>do dishes</li>
<li>find an office space</li>
<li>learn about a/b testing</li>
<li>raise money</li>
</ul>


<p>or any number of hustlery things.</p>

<p>The &#8220;fund&#8221; provides guidance on these things, points hustlers in the right direction,
but the responsibility is mostly on the hustler to move the needle.</p>

<p>The MVP is what you get, but obviously I&#8217;d like to protect my investment as well, so
if it&#8217;s clear that further development is helpful or required, we&#8217;ll do that as well.
The hustler, of course, will have to justify the development cost (You are the CEO
after all).</p>

<p>If you hit the agreed upon success metrics, then lets talk about building <em>your</em> idea.</p>

<p>The pot of gold at the end of the rainbow is that if you&#8217;re really half the hustler
you claim to be:</p>

<ol>
<li>you&#8217;ll end up with a substantial equity stake in a business I think is profitable</li>
<li>you&#8217;ll have a track record</li>
<li>I&#8217;ll probably be pretty excited about building YOUR product too</li>
</ol>


<p>Show me that you add value. It&#8217;s not hard, but it&#8217;s a lot of work.</p>

<p>Regarding a 5k buy in &#8211; A lot of people will be turned off by this. That&#8217;s ok.  Most
of those &#8220;hustlers&#8221; will talk about ideas for the next year and get nothing done.</p>

<p>Any hustler that can&#8217;t raise $5000 isn&#8217;t much of a hustler at all.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll lose some great hustlers with that filter, but I&#8217;m willing to give that up for the
better signal to noise ratio.</p>

    <article class="post">
	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/how-to-hire-salespeople-for-a-startup/">How to Hire Salespeople for a Startup</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<h2>Before You Post Your Ad</h2>

<h3>Don&#8217;t be afraid to spend 25 bucks on a job post</h3>

<p>Say what you will about Craigslist, it&#8217;s still where everyone goes to find jobs.
It costs $25 to post in the jobs section. You can post in the gigs section for free. If you&#8217;re not ready to invest $25 to get better candidates,
you&#8217;re not ready to invest in a salesperson.</p>

<h3>Don&#8217;t make it too easy</h3>

<p>Don&#8217;t give them all the information they need. Make them hunt through your website for
your contact info. Or linked in. Make your information available, but not obvious. This will weed out people who are just mass mailing
resumes.</p>

<h3>Set up phone interviews</h3>

<p>Set up a phone interview for some time in the future. Give them 2 options, and ask them to pick one that works for them. Have them call you
at the stated time. You are looking for: (a) a confirmation email &#8220;yes, i&#8217;ll call you at time X&#8221;, and (b) that they actually call on time.</p>

<p>These are important because they weed out (a) people who can&#8217;t communicate clearly about future events/expectations and (b) candidates who
are unreliable or can&#8217;t manage their calendar [managing future calls is important for followups to prospects]</p>

<h3>The interview starts when they contact you first</h3>

<p>Typos in emails, an inability to communicate effectively via email, unreliable, missed phone calls, are all reasons to end the process.
There are lots of fantastic salespeople out there, don&#8217;t settle for those with obvious deficits.</p>

<h2>The Phone Interview</h2>

<h3>If you aren&#8217;t convinced by the interview, prospects won&#8217;t be convinced by their sales pitch</h3>

<p>The phone interview is a sales call where the salesperson is selling himself to you.
Is he smooth on the phone, does he guide the conversation, does he ask good questions, is
he personable, do you like him?</p>

<ul>
<li>Do they ramble? If they do, let them go. See how long it goes. Sales isn&#8217;t about the salesperson, it&#8217;s about the prospect. Talking forever about themselves is a negative indicator.</li>
<li>If the conversation stops, do NOT fill the space for them &#8211; see what they do with the awkward silence.</li>
<li>Do they overuse filler words like &#8220;um&#8221; and &#8220;like&#8221;? You want someone that sounds smooth, assertive, and confident. If they don&#8217;t sound professional and convincing in an interview, they won&#8217;t when they sell your product.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Great candidates will ask you questions about the role, what you need, and tell you if it&#8217;s a good fit.</h3>

<p>Awesomeness doesn&#8217;t happen in a vacuum. You don&#8217;t want a candidate who is just awesome alone &#8211;
he/she has to be awesome with your product.</p>

<p>Do they tell stories about themselves like they&#8217;re trying too hard to sell themselves? Great sales
is about finding <strong>FIT</strong>, not talking about how AWESOME your product is.  They should be asking about
your NEEDS and seeing how they can fill them.  They should be asking a lot of questions, not regaling
you with stories of how much revenue they closed in an unrelated industry.</p>

<p><strong>There&#8217;s no perfect salesperson and there&#8217;s no perfect product.</strong></p>

<p>The salesperson&#8217;s job is to find out the prospect&#8217;s needs/pain points, then show how your product
can solve that. If he&#8217;s not looking for fit between him and you, he won&#8217;t be looking for fit between
your product and your customers.</p>

<h3>What sorts of things can&#8217;t you sell / What was the hardest thing you&#8217;ve ever had to sell?</h3>

<p>Salespeople love to say they can sell anything. That&#8217;s never true. Some products
are too expensive, or don&#8217;t have product-market fit, or just plain suck.  Ask what they struggled to sell or
what sorts of products they think they wouldn&#8217;t be able to sell. If the answer is &#8220;nothing&#8221;, it indicates
either delusion or an inability to reason.</p>

<h3>Metrics</h3>

<p>Ask them what sorts of metrics they track and how they track them.  Calls, decision makers, demos, etc.
How do they typically gauge success?</p>

<p>Also, what system do they use for tracking it (assuming you don&#8217;t already
have this stuff in place).  As a founder, your job isn&#8217;t to train people to sell. You want people who
already think about this the right way. You need metrics, and good salespeople will have answers for you.</p>

<h3>Do they set a time to follow up?</h3>

<p><strong>This is important.</strong></p>

<p>Wind down the interview in typical fashion. Thank them for their time. Don&#8217;t offer any future plans. Refrain from
saying &#8220;ok, if i&#8217;m interested, i&#8217;ll get back to you next week&#8221; or something like that. Just thank them.</p>

<p>A salesperson&#8217;s
job is to make sales. But many products require multiple touchpoints with busy people. Your salesperson needs to
be effective at getting to the next step.</p>

<p>Salespeople can waste a
lot of time chasing dead leads that aren&#8217;t interested.  To be efficient, they need to be able to identify which leads
are dead and prune them. At the end of any sales call, they should be either:</p>

<ul>
<li>(a) realizing that the lead is no good, or</li>
<li>(b) scheduling a specific follow up time</li>
</ul>


<p>If they don&#8217;t either (a) try to eliminate themselves from the running, or (b) nail you down to a specific future time,
won&#8217;t do that with prospects.</p>

<p>Great questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>&#8220;What are you looking for in order to make a decision&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;What could make you decide to either hire me or eliminate me as a candidate right now?&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;In what timeframe do you intend to make a decision&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;OK, so if I don&#8217;t hear from you by Friday, would it be ok for me to reach out to you on Monday to follow up?&#8221;</li>
</ul>


<p>The result of this is that they&#8217;ll be forced to follow up in the future. See if they do.
If they can&#8217;t get their calendar together for a job, they&#8217;ll fail with prospects.</p>

<h2>Other thoughts</h2>

<h3>Typing speed</h3>

<p>This is usually a pretty good indicator of computer usage and that&#8217;s important to me:</p>

<ul>
<li>I do screensharing demos for Rocket Lease. A prospect gets bored watching you slowly type in a bunch of fields on a form.</li>
<li>I communicate via email. If written text is important for you to communicate, you probably type reasonably fast as well.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Hotmail accounts</h3>

<p>This is a bad filter, and I don&#8217;t recommend it for everyone, but if you&#8217;re writing me from a hotmail
account, wtf? Who uses that anymore?</p>

<p>I sell a tech product, and most people who live on the internet don&#8217;t use hotmail anymore.</p>

<h3>Ask your interviewee what you should be looking for</h3>

<p>You want candidates who are realistic, and can make decisions on behalf of your company. Ask the candidate
what he/she thinks you should be looking for in a hire. Basically, put him/her in the interviewer&#8217;s shoes.</p>

<p>Great candidates are comfortable stepping outside of the interviewee role and giving answers that aren&#8217;t
just &#8220;pick me, pick me!&#8221;</p>

<h3>Try to talk them out of the job (thanks TG)</h3>

<p><em>&#8220;This job isn&#8217;t for everyone&#8230; Well, we&#8217;re a startup, and so a lot of times that means it&#8217;s not very structured&#8230; some
people hate that&#8230; you may be able to make more money in the short term somewhere else&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>

<p>You&#8217;re not trying to scare them off, but this will help bring out some of the real issues with the job, their requirements,
and determine if it&#8217;s really a fit.</p>

<p>This might seem like you&#8217;re scaring away good candidates, but if you start down a path with someone where it&#8217;s not a fit,
you&#8217;ll be wasting your own time and resources, so you&#8217;d rather filter aggressively and be left with more high probability candidates.</p>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/rocket-lease-2012-what-worked/">Rocket Lease 2012: What Worked, What Didn&#8217;t, What&#8217;s Next</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><a href="http://www.rocketlease.com">Rocket Lease</a> makes it easy for landlords to use an online application to screen prospective tenants. It automatically runs credit reports, background checks, and eviction histories, saving the property manager time and money. I believe so strongly in the product that I left my career as an overpaid options trader and to the point where I&#8217;ve <a href="http://blog.ezliu.com/blog/financing-my-startup-with-my-401k/">invested money from my retirement funds</a> into the venture.</p>

<p>I started working on Rocket Lease full time in Dec 2011 and publicly launched in May 2012. It has been my fulltime pursuit since. I am confident (perhaps delusional) that this is the best startup idea I&#8217;ve worked on to date and that my effort will ultimately be rewarded.</p>

<p>However, the journey hasn&#8217;t been without trials, so this is a short note chronicling the successes and failures to date.</p>

<h2>Things That Worked</h2>

<h3>Talked to a lot of customers before I building</h3>

<p>I worked with property managers and leasing agents to draw wireframes, describe the process and workflow. I did this at bars, coffee shops, and while working out of their offices alongside them.  This was important for me to create the right product for my customers.  One caveat is that I wasn&#8217;t aggressive enough about defining the truly MINIMUM viable product, so as a result of talking to many people, I ended up building in more features than necessary and spending more time than I had to on my MVP.</p>

<h3>Spend money on the startup</h3>

<p>It was easy for me in the past to try to build everything (there&#8217;s no better price than free!) and end up wasting a lot of time.  On Rocket Lease, I took the opposite approach, where I almost always try to find some way to NOT build something in house.  Same thing goes for services &#8211; instead of looking for free services or straining to say on a free plan in a Freemium or SAAS offering, if what I need costs money, just pay it. Some services that have made my life better: codebasehq.com, linode, mailchimp, sanebox, hipchat, idonethis, twilio, skype.</p>

<h3>Spend money on me</h3>

<p>In previous startups, I had taken the approach that I&#8217;m cash strapped, so I had to <em>act</em> cash strapped. Don&#8217;t go out, don&#8217;t see friends, work all the time.  You probably already know this story ends in me burning out.  While I still work on Rocket Lease 7 days a week and think about it 25 hours a day, I&#8217;m unapologetic about carving out personal time and enjoying sushi.  I suspect, though can&#8217;t prove, that it&#8217;s made me more productive overall.</p>

<h3>Outsource</h3>

<p>My to do list is a mile long, and a lot of those tasks are outsourceable.  I have found a fantastic blog writer (thanks Jake) who helps me manage content creation, I&#8217;ve outsourced SEO consulting and execution, VA tasks like compiling lists of property managers, sending emails to investors, making sales phone calls, picking up dry cleaning, creating twitter accounts (yep, tons of em) and sending boxes of chocolate to customers.  My biggest single outsourcing expense is programming now. I initially wrote a lot of the code, the first version was built entirely by me, but I&#8217;ve since reduced my code contribution to &lt; 20%.  I still help architect, discuss and evaluate code, but I now focus almost entirely on how to get traction.  Henrique isn&#8217;t just a hired gun, he&#8217;s a CTO for hire, a trusted and valued asset, and Rocket Lease wouldn&#8217;t be possible without him.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve spent a lot on outsourcing, but my quality of life is definitely better as a result.</p>

<h3>Interns</h3>

<p>I experimented with interns this summer.  What I will say about interns is that I&#8217;m glad I did it, and there were a lot of great things that came of it, but it was largely inefficient for me.  My interns were all really awesome, highly intelligent, but it&#8217;s impossible to expect anyone to have the same level of fanaticism about your startup that you do.  Also, this isn&#8217;t a knock on interns &#8211; it&#8217;s always hard to find good PEOPLE, whether interns, full-time, paid or unpaid. In that regard I was lucky that Mike found the highest quality people to work with.  It was a good experience for me, I spent a lot of time, got more frustrated than I should have, but also learned a lot about managing people (and about my desire to manage people going forward).</p>

<h2>Things that didn&#8217;t work</h2>

<h3>SEO</h3>

<p>I suck at this. I spent an inordinate amount of effort early on trying to rank for keywords that I thought were valuable.  Unfortuantely, the reality is that people don&#8217;t search for online apartments application solutions. They search for apartments.  And these folks are tenants, who are NOT Rocket Lease&#8217;s primary customer.</p>

<p>Anyone who is already renting apartments (my target customers) already has <em>A</em> solution in place that works.  The only time they start looking is when their existing solution breaks. And even then they might not turn to Google.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t want to knock this entirely, because we&#8217;ve done very well with words that we wanted to rank for, and over 70% of our revenue last year came from customers who found us via Google. But they are relatively low volume keywords, so I think we&#8217;re tapped out on the total amount of traffic we can drive through the existing keywords we targeted.  The next tier of keywords up that we&#8217;d LOVE to rank for seem way out of reach though, so I&#8217;m hesitant to expend more effort chasing HUGE keywords.</p>

<h3>Adwords</h3>

<p>I suck at this too. I wrote about my experience with Adwords <a href="http://blog.ezliu.com/blog/currently-paying-150-per-conversion/">here</a>. Fundamentally, I think the real problem here is that not enough apartment owners and landlords are LOOKING for rental application solutions.  Arguably I should just keep this going though since I think it can be cost effective, but optimizing the campaign was a lot of work, and at the time it was unclear whether or not it <em>would</em> pay off.  Unfortunately also, since the search volume for high converting keywords is low, it seems like it would take a long time to optimize the effort to pay off.  Also, the high converting keywords seem in striking range for organic search rankings.</p>

<h3>Reddit</h3>

<p>I ran ads on reddit. I wasn&#8217;t trying to recruit users though, I was trying to recruit evangelists.</p>

<p>I was very explicit and the ad copy was basically &#8220;I need your help, Reddit&#8221;. I briefly explained what Rocket Lease was, how I think it&#8217;s insane that 88% of rental applications are still processed on paper, and made it easy for redditors to send an email to their landlord.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t have much to offer to incentivize Redditors to help me in the cause (I could have done some sort of reward, but Redditors are smarter than that and see through stuff like that).  Redditors have a high concentration of renters who would rather fill out electronic forms than paper. Part of me was hoping that would be enough of an appeal to help me kill the paper application. It wasn&#8217;t. But the campaign was cheap and fast so no regrets.</p>

<h3>Contest</h3>

<p>I created &#8220;win a free month of rent&#8221; contest (capped at $1500 bucks, sorry Manhattan). My target customer is the landlord, but my goal was to reach a huge number of renters and convince them to sell to their landlords. Fundamentally, it was just a lottery: &#8220;give me your email for an entry in the drawing&#8221;.</p>

<p>The bit of cleverness (if I do say so) was that the contest encouraged growth by making it incredibly easy for people to share on FB or twitter, then gave more entries into the contest if (a) they shared, (b) anyone signed up through their fb or twitter updates.  I split tested: just twitter, just facebook, multiple fb options (messaging friends, status update, liking page), and a bunch of other combinations to see how I could maximize collection of emails.</p>

<p>Additionally, there was a customer.io lifecycle email campaign tied to the backend that would notify users whenever someone signed up through one of their links (to encourage them to come back) and mailchimp drip campaign tied to the backend of this that would let them know more about Rocket Lease and also give them tips on how else to share their links to get more conest entries.</p>

<p>There was one slightly nefarious component to this campaign: one of the options for twitter/facebook sharing was to authorize our twitter/facebook app so that we could tweet once a day on the users behalf.  Each tweet/update was tagged with the outgoing message and the time of day.  By A/B testing messages and publication time, we were able to get these links to drive approximately half of our signups.</p>

<p>Total signups 21,065.  Total development time: 1 week. Total cost: $1500.</p>

<p>So I paid around $0.07 per email. To run the campaign for 6 weeks from mid October to the end of November. I guess I&#8217;m not sure if this was a failure. I think with my stated goal of email collection, I did quite good, however, the value of this list is questionable at best, and I can buy targeted lists of opt-in emails from confirmed real estate industry people for around a $.10/email, so its a failure compared to that.</p>

<p>My measured clickthroughs/signups/revenue as a result of this campaign weren&#8217;t that great. However, November was also our best month ever in terms of both traffic and revenue.  As I write this, I feel like I should give this another look.</p>

<h3>Guerilla flyers and stickers</h3>

<p>I printed out flyers, then personally went out and put them on doors. The &#8220;riskiest&#8221; thing I did was print out stickers for Rocket Lease that were designed to fit in the corner of the Redeye (a chicago pop culture newsletter that people read on trains and buses on the way to work), then go around to the newspaper boxes and put one on each newspaper.  It was intended to look as if it was actually sponsored by Redeye, but I was waking up at 4am to go from paper bin to paper bin putting stickers on newspaper covers.</p>

<p>Approximately 1% &#8220;clickthrough rate&#8221; on the URL from the stickers on the Redeyes.</p>

<p>Lots of waking up at 4am, $70 spent on stickers, and basically no results. Huge waste of time.</p>

<h3>Purchased emails</h3>

<p>I bought an email list from one vendor. Sent about 100k emails, and got a huge unsubscribe rate.  In retrospect, the emails probably weren&#8217;t legitimately acquired, and I got more annoyed hate mail than I&#8217;d like to read.  I still think email marketing is valuable, I will probably do it in 2013, but this time I&#8217;ll be smarter about it and get higher quality lists.</p>

<h2>A few things I thought about but didn&#8217;t execute</h2>

<h3>Chalk Art</h3>

<p>Draw rocketlease logos and information on sidewalks around Chicago, maybe or maybe not near leasing agencies&#8230;</p>

<h3>Homeless people</h3>

<p>Can I pay the guys that stand next to the freeway 20 bucks to hold a poster for me? What do these guys generally collect in a day? I wonder if they&#8217;d be game to hold up a big poster for me instead for the same amount of money?</p>

<h2>What&#8217;s Next?</h2>

<p>I have a few for Rocket Lease in 2013. My initial hope had been that using online tactics would work.  I personally have a preference for the sorts of things that CODE can do to spread Rocket Lease because code is the sort of thing that can scale very quickly.  I haven&#8217;t had the best results with that so now I&#8217;m currently experimenting with a more traditional sales approach.</p>

<h3>Cold Calling</h3>

<p>Cold calling leads.  I&#8217;m not sure how this will turn out, but the lead list is bigger than I can handle.  People in real estate are professional networkers and they all post their phone numbers in public forums and websites.</p>

<h3>Door to Door</h3>

<p>In person demos at leasing agencies and property management companies.  I think this will be fruitful, because Rocket Lease is genuinely useful, easier to use, and better than most of the entrenched competition.  The struggle will be identifying qualified candidates and scoring the appointments.  Maybe someone really charismatic can just show up and charm their way into demos?</p>

<h3>College evangelists</h3>

<p>College kids just <em>get</em> Rocket Lease. They&#8217;re also tech savvy and great for doing demos.  Another thought here is that if they&#8217;re connected to the school newspaper somehow, Rocket Lease might be able to score some .edu backlinks.</p>

<h3>Email marketing, round 2</h3>

<p>Email lists are cheaper to buy than I had originally thought.  Even if response rates are low, the numbers are so big that this could work out.</p>

<h3>Auxiliary real estate services</h3>

<p>Leasing agencies want a bunch of things, and online rental applications isn&#8217;t particularly high on the list. I wonder if offering things like lead generation, posting things on craigslist on their behalf, helping them fix their websites &#8211; at cost, or at only a small premium, would help me get in the door to have a trusted relationship where they might start using Rocket Lease.</p>

<p>People in real estate often overpay for development/web design, so there might be a way to add value here. This seems really time consuming, so it&#8217;ll probably be a last resort.</p>

<h2>Wish me luck</h2>

<p>Hopefully 2013 will be the year I finally make it in startupland.  Rocket Lease has been a phenomenal learning experience so far, and I think it has the makings of a great business.  But until it gets real traction, I&#8217;m just another struggling entrepreneur.</p>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/hacking-on-xmas-eve/">Hacking on Xmas Eve</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s Christmas Eve, on a beautiful, sunny, 75 degree afternoon in Texas.</p>

<p>My sister is baking in the kitchen, my dad is workin on some hobby projects
around the house, and my mom is also here milling about the house.  I&#8217;m at the
kitchen table, taking a break from hacking on a little side project I started
with a new friend, AG.</p>

<p>Sunny and 75 degrees has a way of making it not feel quite like the Christmas
stories we&#8217;re watching on the TV that&#8217;s playing in our background, but really,
this is what I like about Christmas &#8211; spending time in the company of family
and friends, with everyone doing what makes them happy.</p>

<h2>Hacking Is Nerd Fun</h2>

<p>I like hacking. My family thinks its work, and most of my friends
do too.  But it&#8217;s not.</p>

<p>Hacking is building. It&#8217;s a hobby. Code is just the medium of digital
craftsmen. It&#8217;s 2012&#8217;s version of building a shelf in the
workshop, tinkering with that project car in the garage, baking to relieve
stress, etc.  It&#8217;s just a electronic version.  It&#8217;s no more antisocial
to stare at a screen than a table saw or under the hood of that old muscle
car. In fact, I get to talk to my family while I hack. It&#8217;s fun.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re a nerd, code an endless supply of puzzles to solve. Nobody will call
you a workaholic for working on a puzzle in your living room, but since
most people use computers against their will at work to create TPS reports,
they don&#8217;t get that this is nerd fun.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not working on anything related to my &#8220;job&#8221; (<a href="http://www.rocketlease.com/">Rocket Lease, online rental applications</a>),
but I&#8217;m using all the same tools. It&#8217;s fun. I&#8217;ve timeboxed a few days off for
building an MVP so its pretty much stress-free creation.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m hacking on Xmas eve, its not work, and I&#8217;m loving it.  I&#8217;m not sure how
to explain to others that this is fun for me, and I&#8217;m not sure if I have to.</p>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/what-would-you-do-if-the-world-might-end-soon/">What Would You Do if the World MIGHT End Soon?</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I was chatting to a friend about doomsday predictions for 12/21/2012 and wondered what I&#8217;d do if I thought that there was some credibility to the Mayan doomsday prophecy.</p>

<p><img src="/images/mayan_doomsday.png" alt="Mayan Doomsday" /></p>

<p>What if we could validate with certainty that there is a 75% chance that the world as we know it will end in 2 weeks.  As a thought experiment, imagine we have a credible threat against planet earth by an alien race.</p>

<p>These aliens have stated that they are going to roll a 4 sided die, and if the outcome is 4, they&#8217;ll be our guardian protectors forever, but if the outcome is 1, 2, or 3 they will annihilate our planet.  This is unstoppable by us.  We believe the threat to be real because they have demonstrated their power by speaking to us and broadcasting the message to the entire planet from light years away (so they&#8217;re too far away for us to even reach them, given our existing technology) and demonstrated their far superior technology.</p>

<p>Anyways, the point is: there is a 75% chance the world will end. There is a 25% chance it won&#8217;t. What do you do with your next 2 weeks?</p>

<p>If you rape and pillage and spend all your money, then there&#8217;s a 25% chance you&#8217;ll be in trouble when they don&#8217;t destroy our planet and life goes back to normal.</p>

<p>If you just go on living life, you&#8217;d be missing out on the opportunity to proclaim your love to your crush or blow your 401k on the lifestyle you could never have.</p>

<p>What would you do? How does that change if the odds of doomsday are increased to 90% or decreased to 10%?</p>

<p><img src="/images/ohpress.jpg" alt="Overhead Press" /></p>

<p>I was looking up crossfit related pictures yesterday. I love this picture and it&#8217;s my blog so I get to do whatever I want. Booyah.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<h1>Ebook: Developing Intuitions about Options</h1>

<p>I&#8217;m writing an ebook to help people <em>truly</em> understand options.</p>

<p>Before my startup life, I was an options marketmaker and quantitative trader.  I was one of the
designated primary marketmakers (DPM) for one the the largest ETFs (SPY) at the CBOE,
where we were doing between 30-40% of the total nationwide SPY volume.
Additionally I operated a VIX DPM and have traded other ETFs, equities, indexes,
and commodities extensively.</p>

<p>Most importantly, I was involved in educating and mentoring other options professionals
and I believe that the standard path of options education fails to give students
a deep-seated understanding of options.</p>

<p>A series of excellent &#8221;<a href="https://datanitro.com/blog/2012/11/13/Options/">introducing options</a>&#8221;
posts by <a href="https://datanitro.com/">DataNitro</a>
reminded me of this so I quickly started writing a short ebook.</p>

<p>The purpose of this ebook is to jump start a deeper <strong>intuition</strong> about options pricing and
behavior for people who have an introductory understanding of the topic.</p>

<p>My intent is to publish the chapters individually for feedback.</p>

<p>The ebook will be published on <a href="https://leanpub.com/options">leanpub</a> and the text is available
(for now) on <a href="https://github.com/ezl/optionsbook/blob/master/what_are_options.txt">Github</a>. I welcome pull requests and feedback.</p>

<h1>What Are Options?</h1>

<p>This is a short primer to refresh your memory if it&#8217;s been a while, but definitely not a substitute for learning options basics.</p>

<p>If you know options, you may find this dull or repetitive.  In my experience,
when teaching options, students often find it helpful to hear the same thing
several different ways, even if it means explicitly stating facts that are
already implied (e.g. repeating examples with call and put).</p>

<p>An option is a financial derivative that confers upon the holder the right, but not the obligation, to make a future transaction with the counterparty.
Every options transaction has two parties:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>A buyer</strong>:  The owner of the option. The buyer has the sole decision of whether or not the option will be exercised.</li>
<li><strong>A seller</strong>: Often referred to as the &#8220;writer&#8221; of the option. The seller has no say in whether the option will be exercised, but will have to fulfill the obligation detailed by the contract if the option is exercised</li>
</ul>


<p>An option is described by:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Underlying asset</strong>: asset that can be transacted at a future date, for example AAPL stock or bushels of corn) (1)</li>
<li><strong>Expiration date</strong>: last date on which the option can be exercised (2)</li>
<li><strong>Strike price</strong>: price at which the underlying will be transacted, if the option is exercised by the buyer</li>
<li><strong>Option type</strong>: call or put</li>
</ul>


<h2>Option Trade Example</h2>

<h3>Anatomy of an Option Symbol</h3>

<p>As an example, let&#8217;s use the &#8220;AAPL 11/23/2012 590C&#8221; (pronounced the &#8220;Apple Nov five-ninety call&#8221;):</p>

<p><img src="/images/options/what_are_options_1.jpg" alt="Option name breakdown" /></p>

<ol>
<li>Generally there is one expiration per month for every underlying asset (3), so the expiration date will be referred to by just the month, and not the day.</li>
<li>Commonly used US exchange-traded equity options are generally American options (AAPL is)</li>
<li>Commonly used US exchange-traded equity options are good for 100 shares of the underlying stock</li>
<li>The actual cash outlay is 100 times the listed option price (100 multiplier)</li>
<li>&#8220;C&#8221; and &#8220;P&#8221; are commonly used for &#8220;Call&#8221; and &#8220;Put&#8221;</li>
</ol>


<h3>Sample Trade Mechanics</h3>

<p>If Bob buys one AAPL 11/23/2012 590C from Sue:</p>

<ol>
<li>Bob will pay Sue a small amount of money today. This is the option price,
or premium.  If the price listed on his trading screen or Interactive
Brokers account is $1.65, he will actually pay $165.00 (plus fees).</li>
<li>In return, Sue will have promised Bob that he can buy exactly 100 shares
AAPL from her at the price of $590 any time on or before 11/23/2012.</li>
<li>Bob isn&#8217;t incentivized to pay 590 for AAPL at any time on or before
11/23/2012 unless the market stock price is greater than $590 (otherwise
he could just pay the market price and get it cheaper).</li>
<li>If the publicly traded price of AAPL on 11/23 is 610, Bob would
benefit by exercising his option. He would pay 590 on 100 shares of
AAPL, 20 points cheaper than the market price.</li>
<li>Sue would be obligated to sell at this price, a 20 point loss to what
she could have achieved by selling to the broad market.</li>
<li>Bob is the only person in this transaction who has the power to
decide whether this option is exercised (he probably should, but it
is possible to choose not to exercise).</li>
<li>If Bob exercises the call , Sue <em>must</em> deliver 100 shares of AAPL for the total
price of 100 * 590 == 59,000 &#8211; regardless of the current market price
for AAPL.</li>
<li>In principle, it possible for Bob to exercise his 590 call even if
the AAPL underlying was trading below 590. If AAPL were trading a lower
price, like 550, Bob would be
voluntarily paying 590 for the AAPL call via option exercise, despite the
fact the fact that he could buy it in the marketplace for 550. He would
be losing out on $40/share for 100 shares, effectively throwing away
$4000. This would be stupid, and it never happens, but it is <em>possible</em>.</li>
</ol>


<p>For clarity, and at the risk of repetitiveness, I&#8217;ll repeat this description
for an example where Bob buys one AAPL 11/23/2012 550P from Sue:</p>

<ol>
<li>Bob will pay Sue a small amount of money today. This is the option price,
or premium.  If the price listed on his trading screen or Interactive
Brokers account is $2.19, he will actually pay $219.00 (plus fees).</li>
<li>In return, Sue will have promised Bob that he can sell exactly 100 shares
AAPL to her at the price of $550 any time on or before 11/23/2012.</li>
<li>Bob isn&#8217;t incentivized to sell AAPL at 550 at any time on or before
11/23/2012 unless the market stock price is less than $550 (otherwise
he could just sell it to the best bid in the market to get a better price).</li>
<li>If the publicly traded price of AAPL on 11/23 is 530, Bob would
benefit by exercising his put. He would sell 100 shares of AAPL to Sue at
550, 20 points higher than the market price</li>
<li>Sue would be obligated to buy at this price, a 20 point loss to what
she could have achieved by buying AAPL from the public markets (530 * 100
vs 550 * 100).</li>
<li>Bob is the only person in this transaction who has the power to
decide whether this option is exercised (he probably should, but it
is possible to choose not to exercise).</li>
<li>If Bob exercises the put, Sue <em>must</em> pay him 100 * 550 == 55,000 in
return for 100 shares of AAPL &#8211; regardless of the current market price
for AAPL.</li>
<li>In principle, it possible for Bob to exercise his 550 put even if
the AAPL underlying was trading above 550. If AAPL were trading a higher
price, like 580, Bob is
voluntarily selling AAPL stock at  550 via option exercise, despite the
fact the fact that he could sell it in the marketplace at 580. He would
be losing out on $30/share for 100 shares, effectively throwing away
$3000. This would be stupid, and it never happens, but it is <em>possible</em>.</li>
</ol>


<p>The rules and specific mechanics of these exercise transactions are governed
through networks of brokerage firms, exchanges, and a governing body called
the Options Clearing Corporation (optionsclearing.com), so Bob and Sue never
actually get directly in contact with one another, and there is virtually no
risk to Bob that Sue will be unable or unwilling to fulfil her obligation if
the option is exercised.</p>

<p>The privilege of exercising an option belongs solely to the buyer of the
option. The seller of the option is subject to the whims of the buyer.
However, this behavior is generally very predictable and guided by rules for
optimal option exercise (how to maximize expected value via exercise), so
professional options traders generally are always aware of when this will
happen and can prepare accordingly.</p>

<p>In the early examples, I may only refer to either a put option or a call option. Don&#8217;t worry about the difference between the two, your goal is first to try to get a deeper, non-technical, intuition of how options work and what makes them tick.  Also, for reasons you&#8217;ll see later, calls and puts are very similar and there are operations to convert one into the other for very low cost (put call parity).</p>

<h2>Option Expiration Payouts</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s useful to think of the option payout as the amount of money you would profit by exercising your option then reversing the stock transaction immediately at the market price.</p>

<p>For example, in the above example where Bob purchased 1 AAPL 590C from Sue, if AAPL stock rallied to 605, Bob would want to exercise the option.</p>

<p>It can be daunting to think of paying 590 * 100 == USD$59,000 to exercise your option.  Instead, think of it as paying 590 and simultaneously selling at 605 (the market price), you&#8217;re engaging in a transaction where you earn $15.00 for every share of stock you transact.</p>

<p>There are only 4 possible positions you can hold (or any combination of the
following). For these 4 examples, we&#8217;ll use the ACME 100 call and ACME 100
put.</p>

<h3>Long Call</h3>

<p>A positive number of calls / &#8220;you are long calls&#8221;</p>

<p><img src="/images/options/what_are_options_longcall.jpg" alt="Long call" /></p>

<h3>Short Call</h3>

<p>A negative number of calls / &#8220;you are short calls&#8221;</p>

<p><img src="/images/options/what_are_options_shortcall.jpg" alt="Short call" /></p>

<h3>Long Put</h3>

<p>A positive number of puts / &#8220;you are long puts&#8221;</p>

<p><img src="/images/options/what_are_options_longput.jpg" alt="Long put" /></p>

<h3>Short Put</h3>

<p>A negative number of puts / &#8220;you are short puts&#8221;</p>

<p><img src="/images/options/what_are_options_shortput.jpg" alt="Short put" /></p>

<p>In each of the graphs:</p>

<p><strong>The green line is the value that option has at expiration</strong> at all possible
stock settlement prices on the expiration date. For example, the &#8220;Long Call&#8221;
plot shows the value of the ACME 100 call at various settlements of the
underlying.  There is a prominent bend in the green line at x==100. To the
left (at underlying prices less than 100), the slope is 0, meaning the
payout at expiration of the option is unchanging below underlying prices of
100. Above stock prices of 100, the expiration payout rises with a slope of
1, so the call option increases at the same rate as the underlying stock.</p>

<p><strong>The traded price of the option is the vertical distance ($) between the
horizontal part of the green line and the x axis (where P&amp;L==0)</strong>. For long
option positions, this value is a negative number, reflecting the fact that
the buyer of the option paid money (incurred an outflow of cash) in order to
acquire the position. Conversely, for negative option positions, the
horizontal component of the expiration payout is above 0, indicating that
the seller receives a cash transfusion to acquire the short option position.</p>

<p>The breakeven stock price for a long option is the underlying price at which the
gains from option offset the price paid for the option. The breakeven stock
price for a short option is the underlying price at which the losses from
the option offset the option premium collected at sale time.  This is where
the P&amp;L plot crosses the x-axis.</p>

<p><strong>The dotted red line is the option value at a time before the option
expires.</strong> In this case, I&#8217;ve arbitrarily chosen 60 days, but the salient
point here is that there is still uncertainty in the underlying stock&#8217;s
settlement price (volatility value).  This value is positive and therefore
adds additional value to the option beyond the expiration payout value (the
green line).</p>

<p>This plot is always:</p>

<ul>
<li>curved (as long as there is uncertainty in underlying price)</li>
<li>monotonically increasing for calls (monotonically decreasing for puts)</li>
<li>converges to the expiration plot (the red line) as volatility or time to expiration decreases</li>
<li>asymptotically approaches the expiration plot as distance from strike price increases</li>
</ul>


<p>The total option value can be thought of as the sum of:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Intrinsic value</strong>: The &#8220;zero vol value&#8221;, i.e. the amount of money that
would be made or lost if the stock never moved again between now and
expiration, if the future volatility were zero, or there was no time to
expiration remaining (the green line)</li>
<li><strong>Volatility value</strong>: The amount of option value that can be attributed to
optionality conferred to the options buyer due to uncertainty in the
underlying price between now and the expiration time of the option (the
vertical distance between the green line and dotted red line)</li>
</ul>


<hr />

<p>Footnotes</p>

<p>(1) Options typically expire into an underlying asset of some sort, typically shares of stock (stock options, like AAPL), futures (S&amp;P500 futures options), or physical goods (commodities like oil, corn, and gold).  For simplicity, I&#8217;ll often just use stock.  While there are differences between different underlying settlements, we won&#8217;t address them in this text, and those differences are typically highly specialized and the domain of high volume professionals that don&#8217;t impact non-professional investors and won&#8217;t aid in helping you develop INTUITION about option pricing and behavior, which is the explicit goal of this text.</p>

<p>(2) Exercise type (European or American) is defined at the symbol level and implicit in the entire class of options, so rarely explicitly stated on the option.</p>

<ul>
<li>European options may be exercised at exactly ONE time: the day of expiration.</li>
<li>American options may be exercised at any time before the expiration date.</li>
<li>Most US traded listed stocks, and generally the sorts of options that non-professionals trade, are American options.</li>
<li>For now, forget about the difference between American and European options. We&#8217;ll initially begin by discussing European options, then discuss how American options differ at a later time.</li>
</ul>


<p>(3) not actually true, because of weeklies, dailies, alt settlements, but true enough&#8230;</p>

<h1>Did You Make It This Far?</h1>

<p>If so, I&#8217;d really like your feedback.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m pretty close to the topic, so its impossible for me to know if I&#8217;m describing it
in a way that resonates with you.  This particular piece is an intro, but what I&#8217;m
really excited about is pushing an intuition about why options even HAVE value, and
making it so that you can explain this to others (if you can&#8217;t explain it other than
to say &#8220;use this formula&#8221;, you don&#8217;t <em>really</em> understand it).</p>

<p>The ebook will be published on <a href="https://leanpub.com/options">leanpub</a> and the text is available

		<h1>Options Pricing and Behavior Ebook</h1>

<p>I&#8217;m writing an ebook to help people <em>truly</em> understand options.</p>

<p>Before my startup life, I was an options marketmaker and quantitative trader.  I was one of the
designated primary marketmakers (DPM) for one the the largest ETFs (SPY) at the CBOE,
where we were doing between 30-40% of the total nationwide SPY volume.
Additionally I operated a VIX DPM and have traded other ETFs, equities, indexes,
and commodities extensively.</p>

<p>Most importantly, I was involved in educating and mentoring other options professionals
and I believe that the standard path of options education fails to give students
a deep-seated understanding of options.</p>

<p>A series of excellent &#8221;<a href="https://datanitro.com/blog/2012/11/13/Options/">introducing options</a>&#8221;
posts by <a href="https://datanitro.com/">DataNitro</a>
reminded me of this so I quickly started writing a short ebook.</p>

<p>The purpose of this ebook is to jump start a deeper <strong>intuition</strong> about options pricing and
behavior for people who have an introductory understanding of the topic.</p>

<p>My intent is to publish the chapters individually for feedback.</p>

<p>The ebook will be published on <a href="https://leanpub.com/options">leanpub</a> and the text is available
(for now) on <a href="https://github.com/ezl/optionsbook/blob/master/random_walks.txt">Github</a>. I welcome pull requests and feedback.</p>

<h1>Random Walks</h1>

<p>Before we discuss option valuation, we have to touch on the behavior of the underlying stock.</p>

<p>Option value is based on the behavior of the option&#8217;s underlying stock. More
specifically, options have value because there is uncertainty in the future
price of a stock and options guarantee the bearer certainty in an otherwise
uncertain future.</p>

<p>We can&#8217;t know the exact path that a stock&#8217;s price will take in the
future. Instead, we characterize the stock&#8217;s behavior and use that to
describe all the <em>possible</em> future states of the stock.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>AAPL stock settled today, Nov 20 2012 at 560.91/share.
Throughout the course of the day tomorrow, indepent market participants will
buy and sell shares of AAPL, causing the price to move up and down,
seemingly at random.</p>

<p>At each moment in the day, the next price that prints on the AAPL ticker may
be either higher, lower, or the same as than the current price &#8211; this is unpredictable
(and not necessarily equally probable).</p>

<p>It&#8217;s useful to imagine the stock price like a ball running through a series
of pins:</p>

<p><img src="/images/options/randomwalks_1.png" alt="A ball running through pins mimics price behavior" /></p>

<p>This uncertain, stochastic price movement over time is referred to as a &#8220;random walk&#8221;.</p>

<p>While you don&#8217;t know what price AAPL will settle tomorrow, you might have a
guess that some settlement prices are more likely than others.</p>

<p>Given, for example, the fact that AAPL has closed between 550 and 575 for
the last 10 days, you might say it is highly improbable for AAPL to close
between 0 and 100 tomorrow. It is highly probable that AAPL will close
between 500 and 650 per share. It&#8217;s also improbable that AAPL will close
between $10,000 and $10,100 per share.</p>

<p>Starting with $100 wide buckets, we can create a histogram of what might be
a reasonable guess for where AAPL settles tomorrow.</p>

<p><img src="/images/options/random_walks_2.jpg" alt="100-wide bucket histogram of AAPL 1-day price distribution" /></p>

<p>Now repeat this exercise for increasingly small buckets to get a continuous distribution of infinitely small buckets (or at least penny sized).</p>

<p><img src="/images/options/random_walks_3.jpg" alt="25-wide bucket histogram of AAPL 1-day price distribution" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/options/random_walks_4.jpg" alt="5-wide bucket histogram of AAPL 1-day price distribution" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/options/random_walks_5.jpg" alt="Continuous function of AAPL 1-day price distribution" /></p>

<p>This is where you think the AAPL stock price will settle tomorrow, described as a
<strong>probability density function</strong> of possible prices for a specific instant
in time in the future.</p>

<p>Now imagine repeating this process for every time step between now and the
expiration.  The further away the end date is, the more pins the ball will
run through, increasing the probability of drifting further from the current price.</p>

<p>An expected 3 month price distribution might look like:</p>

<p><img src="/images/options/random_walks_6.jpg" alt="AAPL 3-mo price distribution" /></p>

<p>Stocks that move more (higher volatility) and have longer times to expiration generate wider probability distributions. Stocks that move less (lower volatility) and shorter times will result in narrower probability distributions.</p>

<p><img src="/images/options/random_walks_7.jpg" alt="Terminal distributions for constant vol/varying time" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/options/random_walks_8.jpg" alt="Terminal distributions for varying vol/constant time" /></p>

<p>There are many different models for how a stock price &#8220;walks&#8221;. For the
purposes of developing intuitions about where options get value, they&#8217;re not
particularly important. The important thing to note is that there is
uncertainty in the future price, which can be described as a probability distribution
of possible stock prices at a specific expiration date.</p>

<p>Different models produce different shapes of probability distributions at expiration
(often referred to as the &#8220;terminal price distribution&#8221;).  Option valuation and expected
behavior is premised almost entirely on the characteristics of this distribution and
the possible paths between today&#8217;s price and the future price.</p>

<h1>Did You Make It This Far?</h1>

<p>If so, I&#8217;d really like your feedback.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m pretty close to the topic, so its impossible for me to know if I&#8217;m describing it
in a way that resonates with you.  This particular piece is an intro, but what I&#8217;m
really excited about is pushing an intuition about why options even HAVE value, and

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/financing-my-startup-with-my-401k/">Financing My Startup With My 401k</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>As of one week ago, I am officially funding <a href="http://www.rocketlease.com">Rocket Lease</a> with retirement fund money. This was not a decision made in haste. You may think I&#8217;m an idiot, and you may be right.</p>

<p><strong style="color:#D20606">This is a statement of fact documenting an action I took, not a &#8220;How To&#8221; document or a recommendation for anyone to do the same.</strong></p>

<h2>Retirement Money Isn&#8217;t Sacred</h2>

<p>I am aware that many people consider 401k money off-limits. I consider it just another pool of capital with different access restrictions. I believe myself to be (mostly) rational in matters of risk/reward analysis especially pertaining to financial decisions.  Despite the obvious uncertainty in the future and the risk, I stand by this decision. Will it work out for me? Maybe not.</p>

<p>I am not interested in debating the merits of retirement savings and safety funds. Different people have different needs, desires, risk tolerances. This fit the bill for me. (Also, don&#8217;t tell my mom. She falls on the side of safety, as mothers often do.)</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll also say there was a weirdly sick exhiliration in cutting into my safety money to finance Rocket Lease. It made me realize:</p>

<ul>
<li>Yes, I&#8217;m dead serious about this.</li>
<li>Yes, I believe Rocket Lease will be a winner.</li>
<li>Yes, there are challenges ahead.</li>
<li>No, success is not certain.</li>
<li>Yes, I could fail and that would suck.</li>
</ul>


<p>The moment I got my check it suddenly became more real that I&#8217;m committed to the success of my current venture and that I will do whatever it takes to get to the finish line.</p>

<h2>Investing in Me</h2>

<p>This is, more than anything, an investment in myself.</p>

<p>I believe so strongly that dollars invested into Rocket Lease today can outperform <em>any</em> other investment that I have access to (admittedly not a lot of options&#8230; Weirdly, Jack Dorsey didn&#8217;t call me for a check the last time Square closed a round).</p>

<p>Founders play &#8220;backseat founder&#8221; all the time, telling other startups what they should do. Fundamentally, this is a statement that the company being discussed has some deficiency that the speaker is somehow able to correct &#8211; from the outside, with less information, via his/her brilliant insight.</p>

<p>This is a pervasive attribute of not only startup culture, but popular culture. What Romney could have done to win. What the CEO of ACME Widget Co should be doing. How other people can solve all their problems. Yelp would be better if. How Twitter could make a ton of money. This restaurant would be perfect if they just&#8230;</p>

<p><strong> Everyone other than you is doing it wrong. </strong></p>

<p>Yippee! I get to invest (even more) in me now. If this burns to the ground, it&#8217;ll be on me.</p>

<p>Betting on yourself is great, because you can guarantee that the founder in your investment isn&#8217;t spending his days on facebook or wasting time otherwise (well, sort of).</p>

<h2>There is No Free Lunch</h2>

<p>This is just the trader in me &#8211; every transaction you make in life has risk and reward attached to it. Sushi or steak for dinner? Hire that growth hacker tomorrow or next month? For equity or cash?</p>

<p>I could have tried to raise a seed round. I could have sold equity to friends and family.  These avenues have all sorts of other hidden costs: loss of autonomy, investors to answer to, guilt at losing other people&#8217;s money, the time/effort required to raise, etc.  The relative cost (penalties/fees) of the 401k path seemed more palatable to me in the long run.</p>

<p>Put it another way: Imagine you&#8217;ll have to pay a 10% early distribution penalty and you only need ~40k.  How long does it take you to secure the financing and land the check from external investors, and how much equity do you give up.  Would be willing to pay 4k (10% early distribution penalty) to make all that effort disappear and retain total company equity? The answer to that question was yes for me, so I took an early distribution.</p>

<p>There are cheaper and more expensive transactions. 401k was the cheapest way for me to get what I wanted, and a great bet. I might lose it, but I&#8217;ll be happy that I tried.</p>
