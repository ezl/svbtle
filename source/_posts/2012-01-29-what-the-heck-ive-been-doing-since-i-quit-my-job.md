<p><strong>Quitting Comfort</strong></p>
<p>A while back, I left a cushy options trading job to work on startups.  For me, &#8220;startups&#8221; meant &#8220;websites that make money&#8221;.  The fantasy was that:</p>
<ol><li>income from an online job would let me travel freely and stop setting morning alarm clocks; and</li>
<li>I would work less </li>
</ol><p>How&#8217;d I do? 1. I wildly underestimated how hard it was going to be to make real income online, though I&#8217;ve been fortunate enough to travel a bit. 2. I totally missed the mark on working less. I &#8220;work&#8221; 10x more than I did; in retrospect, though, i don&#8217;t see how I could have worked less than I did at CTC.</p>
<p>There have been times when I&#8217;ve doubted the decision, but for now I&#8217;m happy with it.  Though I work much longer hours, I&#8217;m not forced to live by someone else&#8217;s schedule and I generally find the work engaging.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s funny how it so much easier it is to stomach the long hours and hard work as long as its self inflicted.  The hardest part about being your own boss is the realization that your boss is an asshole that makes you work long hours and pays you nothing.  For me, the win is less about waking up late than the knowledge that i CAN wake up late. Hopefully one day I&#8217;ll exercise that privilege.</p>
<p><strong>Spaciety&#160;: Online Booking for Spas &amp; Salons</strong></p>
<p><img align="left" src="/images/tumblr_lykiikODOo1r6ben5.png" /></p>
<p>Most recently, I spent 3 months with AAD in Cincinnati at a startup incubator called <a href="http://brandery.org/">The Brandery</a>, working on <strong><a href="http://spaciety.com">Spaciety</a>, a website to provide online booking for spas and salons</strong>.  For the people I haven&#8217;t talked to in a while, there are a lot of &#8220;startup incubators&#8221; around the country.  In return for a small equity stake in your startup, they typically give you cash, business coaching, and help you make valuable contacts for 3 months, and put you in front of a lot of investors.  </p>
<p>Spaciety was making a little money, and though AAD and I were confident we could raise financing, the project wasn&#8217;t a good fit for us and our immediate goals, so we pulled the plug shortly after the start of 2012.</p>
<p>No regrets about shutting it down &#8212; I&#8217;m glad I got to work with AAD closely for the duration and we met a lot of great people in Cincinnati.  We really needed that 3 months to give the idea a fair shake and we learned a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Leasely?&#160;: Online Rental Applications and Tenant Screening</strong></p>
<p><img align="left" src="/images/tumblr_lykijgj7in1r6ben5.png" /></p>
<p>Now I&#8217;ve shifted my primary focus to reviving <strong><a href="http://leasely.com">Leasely</a>, online rental applications and tenant screening </strong>&#8212; Leasely is an old startup idea I was working on with rz and wc, but life got in the way and we started working on other things.  That site is not maintained and its incomplete; hopefully a new version of it will be available soon.  The name will probably change as well, so if you have recommendations, I&#8217;d love to hear them.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really excited about working on Leasely.  When rz, wc, and I were initially working on it, I felt pretty strongly that it was the best idea I had worked on.  It seems ridiculous that the majority of apartment applications today still use a paper application form.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m hopeful that 2012 will finally bring some measure of startup success.</p>
