Twas fun. CM moved there, so we went for Sitges Carnivale (sort of) 2012.

Those guys stay up really late. Didn't realize that Barcelona identifies as independent. Reminded me that I'd like to learn Spanish. And live abroad.  That's one of my current biggest regrets.

The trip was really just an excuse to go drinking in Barcelona with CM, JBV, RV, HR.

Things that are great about Barcelona:

Red Solo Cup. CM getting bumped at Sitges. Dicksabers. “Hey guys, can you please make silence.” The best gin and tonics at La Royale. Montiel, best meal of 2012. Tapas 24. Pan con tomate. The realization that Gaudi was almost certainly just always on drugs. When Noelle asked me to guess what she was. Lauren from Hong Kong was awesome.
