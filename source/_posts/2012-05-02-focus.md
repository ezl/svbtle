<strong>What Rocket Lease Does</strong>

<a href="http://www.rocketlease.com"><img class=" wp-image-37   alignright" title="Easy Online Rental Applications" src="http://ezliu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/rl2.png" alt="" width="262" height="137" /></a>

My startup, <strong>Rocket Lease</strong>, provides <a href="http://www.rocketlease.com">online apartment applications</a>. If you rent an apartment in the United States, at some point, you'll probably fill out a paper application form to give the prospective landlord information like: your name, address, social security number, date of birth, current/previous landlords, net worth, income, etc. as a way to qualify yourself as a good tenant. Your landlord will review this and possibly run a credit check to evaluate your candidacy. This frequently still happens on paper. <a href="http://www.rocketlease.com">Rocket Lease</a> makes it happen online.

I tell you this not to pitch my idea to you. I tell you this to convey how small and unambitious it can sound. And to tell you this is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">deliberate strategic decision</span>.

Focus.

<strong>What Rocket Lease Does NOT Do</strong>

Now let me tell you about some of the things I DON'T do:
<ol>
	<li>Help tenants find an apartment</li>
	<li>Help prospective renters choose the best neighborhoods based on nearby bars/restaurants</li>
	<li>Aggregate a list of popular buildings and put out reviews</li>
	<li>Help landlords find qualified leads</li>
	<li>Tell landlords if an applicant will be a good tenant</li>
	<li>Lease signing</li>
	<li>Lead gen for tenant services (move in, move out, maids, painting)</li>
	<li>Process rent payments</li>
	<li>Help roommates share utilities</li>
	<li>Landlord-tenant communication tools</li>
	<li>Landlord financial services (automated tax form generation)</li>
	<li>Maintenance request ticketing system (lead gen for plumbers?)</li>
</ol>
I am not avoiding these because I don't think they're good businesses. They are. By my estimate, almost every single one of these businesses is a $1 billion+ a year market. In fact, I have great friends whose individual startups are tackling some of these other businesses; I hope that some day we'll all collaborate.

<a title="Rocket Lease" href="http://www.rocketlease.com">Rocket Lease</a> is literally just an alternative to an existing process where information is transmitted between two parties by ink on dead-tree paper. It is an HTML form with some functional candy. But it's all I think about and it's going to be a damn good HTML form.

Focus.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">One awesome thing</span> about startups in the rental space is the abundance of free feedback. Everyone knows someone in the rental space -- an uncle that manages property, your landlord, your friend who is a leasing agent, your friend who has rented a place. As a result, most people have dealt with the hassles and frustrations of renting and they volunteer a lot of great feedback.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">One awful thing</span> about startups in the rental space is ... the abundance of free feedback. Everyone knows someone in the rental space... so they have a lot of great ideas about how you could make your business WAAAAY better. "The *real* pain point for leasing agents is finding apartment seekers. If Rocket Lease would only solve leasing agent lead gen, it'd be huge. If it'd only do online rent payments, it'd tap a 3 trillion dollar market."

Focus.

Rocket Lease is as minimal a viable product as I could imagine being useful. I am a landlord. Renting my properties is a pain. There was a time when I had to fax copies of applications to a company in the suburbs of Chicago, and they would fax me back a credit check within 48 hours. This is insane.

The stated goal of Rocket Lease is to make this process suck a little less. The goal is not to make the entire process perfect (yet). Could I do more? You betcha. Will I ever do more? Hopefully. Can I do more now? Not a chance. I can barely keep up as it is.

It would be awesome if Rocket Lease did some of the other things. Sometimes they sound deceptively easy to add on ("hey you're already in the rental space, it's just, like... two more pages..."). Each of those deceptively simple add-on ideas has full startups dedicated exclusively to that niche. I can't possibly compete with them while dividing my attention.

I love what I'm doing, and I think it has the potential to help a lot of people and grow into something huge. For that reason it's really hard not to get excited about adjacent markets and chase tangents. Some people are good at multi-tasking and managing a bunch of different loops. I am not. For that reason precisely, if I'm to *ever* have a shot at doing those other great things, I have to ruthlessly cut them out of my scope today.
