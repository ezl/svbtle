A good friend of mine, let’s call him “Christopher Toppino”, who may or may not be working on a really cool startup called <a href="http://rentshare.com">RentShare</a>, that does <a href="http://rentshare.com">online rent payments</a> and expense sharing between roommates, recently received an unsolicited email:
<blockquote><strong>Subject</strong>: (no subject)
<strong>Date</strong>: May 6, 2012 9:17 AM
<strong>Message</strong>:
Hey there.
Fellow entrepreneur here. I heard about your your site in brooklyn mag and had some thoughts.
<ol>
<li>It’s important to be able to bill different amounts to different roommates for example if we go to a bar and order a different number of drinks we shouldn’t pay the same amount.</li>
<li>Credit card processing fees are really high, so nobody will use that for paying rent.</li>
<li>You should expand the product to be able to split expenses among all friends.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
I happened to be sitting with Chris when he received this email. He didn’t think much of it, but it really got me thinking.

<strong>First impression</strong>: Sweet! That’s so cool. Someone wrote you!
<strong>Second impression</strong>: Pop quiz, asshole. How many of those ideas do you think Chris hasn’t thought of?

<strong>Ideas</strong>

I love talking ideas with people. I love being introduced to new ideas. New ideas often come from other people. There’s no greater compliment than another person volunteering their time and mental energy to something I’ve poured my heart and soul into.

There’s a part of me that jumps with joy whenever someone is so interested in my startup that they spend their valuable time to think about it and give me recommendations/advice.

But sometimes there’s a part of me that cringes because the advice belies an arrogance and presumption of idiocy. And the dividing line between happiness and fury is vanishingly thin.

Part of it is <strong>delivery</strong>. You can do a lot to land on the side away from fury by prefacing a sentence with:
<blockquote>“I’m sure you’ve thought about this way more than me, but…”
“Hmm, I don’t know much about your space, but…”
“There’s probably a good reason why you’re not doing this already…”</blockquote>
These are really transparent, but effective ways that you can soften statements. Sort of like the startup founders’ advice equivalent of:
<blockquote>“I don’t want to sound like a jerk, but… [proceed to say jerk thing]“</blockquote>

No doubt, part of the knee-jerk rejection response is <strong>fear that I’ve have missed something</strong> incredibly obvious that some stranger will be able to call to my attention. It’s really easy to get caught up in your own world, and an outside perspective can do wonders to put things into perspective.

However, the biggest component that determines my response is <strong>how much thought went into the advice</strong>. If the advice is from another founder and is just scratching the surface, it’s almost an insult — “Oh hey, i’ve thought about this for 2 seconds, and I have the brilliant insight that is going to make your startup finally succeed.”

&nbsp;

<strong>Founders Are ________.</strong>

Startup founders are<strong> smart and ambitious</strong>. They create things, often from nothing. They are building empires and fortunes out of their sheer creative genius.

Startup founders are <strong>problem solvers</strong>. They see broken things around us, inefficiencies in the system, and they want to make it better, easier, faster, cheaper.

And startup founders are <strong>arrogant</strong>. As a founder, you need a deep conviction that your project is going to be a success. And odds are good that someone has done something similar before you, so you’re implicitly asserting that you can succeed where others have failed. You must believe that you are, in some critical way, <em><strong>better</strong></em> than the people who preceded you.

And therein lies the problem.

&nbsp;

<strong>If You’re Going To Help, Help.</strong>

If you’re a founder, don’t be the asshole advice giver. If you’re going to try to help, really try to help. The person on the other side of that conversation will likely have thought about the problem more than you (it’s their job). Do I have strategy and product ideas for RentShare? You BET! But they think about RentShare 31 hours a day.

Founders want to engage other founders in meaningful, thoughtful conversations about their obsession. But it’s painful when someone offers the most obvious of advice and is determined to tell you why your approach — that you’ve carefully crafted over hours, days, months of compulsive, obsessive dedication — is wrong.

So the next time you find yourself talking to another founder and saying, “Hey, you know what you should do?” — think carefully about the next words that come out of your mouth.

Put yourself in her shoes for a second and imagine that she is just as smart and ambitious as you, and that she obsesses about her idea for all of her waking hours, ask yourself if it just might be the beginning of another tired conversation about something she knows about, but is too kind to tell you.

Founders want guidance. Founders need guidance. Founders appreciate guidance. Real, useful guidance requires effort.
