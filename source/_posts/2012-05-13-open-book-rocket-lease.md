I am considering posting more openly about what I'm working on with <a href="http://rocketlease.com">Rocket Lease</a>. I generally have enjoyed when other entrepreneurs have done this (Patrick McKenzie of Bingo Card Creator and Johannes Borchardt of http://droid-blog.net/ come to mind).

I have no interest in writing a "how to" guide. I'm considering just being transparent about what I'm working on, what I'm struggling with, how I'm doing it (not how you should do it), and where I'm allocating my efforts.

<strong>Possible Benefits:</strong>
So far I've really enjoyed the feedback I've gotten from people since beginning to write this blog. Having a public place for my writing has connected me to people I would likely have never gotten in touch with.

<strong>Concerns:</strong>
The rental space is really crowded. There's a lurking fear that I shouldn't publicly broadcast my approach to making Rocket Lease awesome. I have competitors. Right now Rocket Lease isn't particularly competitive in the space, but I want it to be, and the fear is that by being open about where I'm allocating my efforts I'll undermine my own efforts. Also, as of now, I'm a single founder. Multiple cofounder teams have a body count advantage over me.

Going to mull this over a bit, but I'm leaning heavily towards doing it -- unless I get too scared.
