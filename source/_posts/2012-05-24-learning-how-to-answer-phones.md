This will sound really silly.

I've been taking support phone calls for <a href="http://www.rocketlease.com/">Rocket Lease</a> and after a few days of awkward phone calls I finally realized that I have no idea how to answer the phone.

I kept going straight into a support call without getting the customer's name, and then doing a "Uh sorry, I forgot your name" while trying to communicate later.

I kept getting hung up because I was trying to squeeze in a "how can I help you today?", but it felt really awkward try to work that into the intro.

So I just called T Mobile and Bank of America to listen to their canned scripts.
<blockquote>"Thank you for calling Bank of America, my name is Jim, may I have your first and last name please."

"Thank you for calling T-Mobile, my name is Kathy, to better assist you may I have your name please?"</blockquote>
My assumption was that an intro has to convey:
- The company you are calling
- My name
- Request for your name
- Indicate desire to assist you

Turns out the anatomy of a support call intro doesn't include the last item. The weird stuff you don't think about when starting a business...
