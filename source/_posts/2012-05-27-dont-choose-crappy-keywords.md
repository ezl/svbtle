title: 'Don''t Choose Crappy Keywords'

---

In my first experiments, I found that <a href="http://ezliu.com/currently-paying-150-per-conversion/">Adwords conversions were costing me almost $150 per conversion</a>. No big surprise, within 10 minutes of looking at the resulting data, I found that I had been bidding for some terrible keywords.
<blockquote>For example:

"<strong>basic rental agreement</strong>" -- this sounds like it might be  pretty good, which is why I threw it in the pool, but the conversion rate was far below the average and it generated lots of clicks (ouch).

It's deceptively promising sounding, but that particular phrase is missing the point of Rocket Lease.  Rocket Lease does the rental *application*; People searching for a "rental agreement" are beyond qualifying tenants and are looking for a standard lease. They don't need what I have to offer. Paying for them to visit my site is basically a donation to Google.  The Adwords data confirms this with a 0%  conversion rate for 450 clicks of that phrase. *</blockquote>
Further digging revealed that I was actually bidding for a lot of keywords that contain the phrase "rental agreement" -- These, as a a group accounted for a lot of clicks, but a very low conversion rate, and costed me<strong> $464.00 per conversion</strong>, or 3x my average conversion rate.

Just excluding the keywords that include "rental agreement" would have brought my conversion cost down <strong>from $149.53 to $101.16 (a 32.9% reduction)</strong>.

Other terms too, like "Free eviction check", didn't do so hot for me, which isn't surprising considering that's not what Rocket Lease does. Hopefully by eliminating the garbage, I can quickly get to even cheaper conversion costs before I even do any on-site conversion optimization.

<strong>Going Forward</strong>

My measured conversion value is $4.63 so that still puts me pretty far away from making AdWords economics work out, but I'm still chasing this thread because:
<ol>
	<li>I think my true conversion value is almost certainly higher. $4.63 was the total estimated conversion value as measured from right after the exploratory AdWords campaign stopped.
		<ul>
			<li>There's a bit of lag between conversion and profit (landlord signs up == conversion, profit occurs when the landlord asks an applicant to fill out an application), and</li>
			<li>that number doesn't account for return customers.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The initial keyword selection was pretty naive (as the "rental agreement" indicates)</li>
	<li>First data also includes exploratory analysis to determine what keywords we should be looking for</li>
	<li>There was a learning period to improve CPC. My friend Jake, during the duration of the initial Adwords run, optimized my campaign substantially for clicks,cutting down my CPC by more than 50% -- however, the data includes the entire learning process.</li>
	<li>There has been no explicit optimization for conversion, through adwords (I think I might get better by controlling max CPC)</li>
	<li>The current site is pretty ugly, and we can probably improve signup/conversion rate on site by making the site better.</li>
</ol>

I can't prove this yet, but I would be surprised if my real customer LTV wasn't north of $25, and I feel pretty confident that by being smarter about keyword selection, doing a little bit to optimize conversion costs in Adwords, and beautifying the home page, I could probably get the conversion cost below $50.00/conversion.

That's still not a win, obviously, but if I'm right that inexperienced me can get within a factor of 2, I'm betting there's a fighting chance that someone better at Adwords can push that into "money machine" territory.
