title: 'Rocket Lease is Ugly'

---

<a href="http://rocketlease.com">Rocket Lease</a> is pretty ugly.  There I said it.

I know it's not the prettiest, and my position until recently has been "Oh well, but it's functional", and that matters way more than "beautiful".  Besides, existing players in the market don't have gorgeous UI's so it's not like I'm losing.

I started checking out the "Visitors Flow" section in my Google Analytics today.  I'm not sure I'm reading it right, but from what I can tell, Visitors Flow seems like a poor man's funnel analysis, without having done any of the work up front to set it up.  Which is great, because I haven't set anything up!

The unfortunate part is that, I'm getting a ~2.2% signup rate.  I'm not sure if its that my messaging is unclear or that my site is too ugly, but I've heard (and agree with feedback) that the site is uninviting.  (Also don't know if that's good or bad or if I can do better or who's coming to my site, but that's something to figure out later...)

Anyways, all the feedback that my site is ugly and that the "borrowed" stock image is terrible has finally sunk in, so I'm in the process of getting a new landing page ready to test, thanks to my good friend Justin K.  A preview of the landing page (don't mind the Lease Rocket / Rocket Lease, Justin was just being playful with that):

Simultaneously, Ryan G is working with me to rethink the internal UI and make it clearer to new users what they need to do. Ryan's a brilliant UI/UX guy and has really helped me narrow down the screens to the bare essentials, helped make the process more fun, and taught me a ton about UI/UX on the way. The new Rocket Lease dashboard and applications will be much slicker, more inviting to users, and easier to understand.  Can't wait to get this stuff live.

Very excited to see if this stuff performs differently and to be able to have something pretty to show off.
