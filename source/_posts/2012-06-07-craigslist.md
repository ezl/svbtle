title: 'Popular Craigslist Spam Tactics for Profit (and for Evil)'
categories: [strategy, startups, rocketlease]

I've always enjoyed <a href="http://davegooden.com/2011/05/how-airbnb-became-a-billion-dollar-company/">Dave Gooden's fantastic writeup</a> about how AirBnB benefitted from email marketing tactics on Craigslist and wondered how prevalent the use of such tactics was. (It'd also be interesting to know if that happens a lot *more* after his blog post was published)

Mike L and I were chatting about it and I decided to chronicle a few craigslist scam/spam/marketing techniques we've seen (with <a href="http://ezl.github.com/craigslistspam/">links to the actual email threads in each section</a>)

<h2><strong>"Unthreatening Potential Female Roommate Just Wants Confirmation That You Can Pay Bills"</strong></h2>
<strong>AKA:</strong> "Please Run A Credit Check"
<strong>Actual Example:</strong> <a href="http://ezl.github.com/craigslistspam/rental1.html">credit</a>
<strong>Beneficiary:</strong> Free Credit Report.com

Mike was looking for a new apartment and responded to an ad in the roommates section. A cute girl responded.

<strong>Notes:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Female responder, girls get better response rates, especially cute ones.</li>
	<li>Wants to make sure you're not a scammer</li>
	<li>Well written email, very conversational, disarming.</li>
	<li>This email is too well crafted, it is unlikely to have been sent through a text spinner -- which means that its probably more targeted, and the risk of being sent to spam folders is much higher.</li>
	<li>Really LONG email. Seriously, whoever did this should rethink it, because nobody reads emails that long. Or is it part of the play? It clearly COULDN'T be a spam message!</li>
	<li>Girl is believably cute, not devastatingly hot.</li>
	<li>Eating ice cream in the picture. Come on, how non-threatening is that?</li>
	<li>Asks you to send her credit check info, but as a helpful citizen tells you to make sure to withold your SSN. Again, she's not a scammer! Conveniently recommends FreeCreditReport.com</li>
</ul>
<strong>Their action:</strong> There are two common plays here.
<ul>
	<li>post ads on craigslist seeking roommates. Whenever someone responds, send them this email encouraging them to try out freecreditreport.com</li>
	<li>Respond to ads where people are seeking roomates. If they respond back, game on.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Benefit of this:</strong> HUGE reduction of total email send volume, everyone who responds to you is already qualifying themselves as an interested candidate and giving you a real email address.

<h2><strong>"Helpful Internet Citizen Trying To Help You Avoid Contractor Woes"</strong></h2>
<strong>Note:</strong> This spam was found to be a third party abusing an affiliate program. The actual company reached out and informed me that they don't condone that behavior and have banned the affiliate marketer. Their logo above was replaced by a photo of a banana. Why? Because I happened to have one in my Wordpress Media Library.

<strong>AKA:</strong> "Let Me Recommend A Site I've Used Successfully"
<strong>Actual Example:</strong> <a href="http://ezl.github.com/craigslistspam/odesk.html">contractor site</a>
<strong>Beneficiary:</strong> An contracting site

I was looking for someone to reskin a wordpress blog for me. A very helpful girl named Ava who recently had a bad craigslist experience wanted to let me know that a specific contracting site gave her better results.

<strong>Notes:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Short and sweet</li>
	<li>Also from a girl</li>
	<li>Voice a common concern, just trying to save you the trouble she went through.</li>
	<li>Smoking gun: the link doesn't go to the site itself. it goes to a click tracking site. Regular humans don't do that.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Their action:</strong> scrape craigslist computer gigs section, respond to everyone and recommend a specific site as a superior alternative.

<h2><strong>"Christian In West Africa Wants To Rent Lovely Home To You"</strong></h2>
<strong>AKA:</strong> "Give Me All Your Info"
<strong>Actual Examples:</strong> <a href="http://ezl.github.com/craigslistspam/rental2a.html">[a]</a> <a href="http://ezl.github.com/craigslistspam/rental2b.html">[b]</a> <a href="http://ezl.github.com/craigslistspam/rental2c.html">[c]</a>
<strong>Beneficiary:</strong> Some scammer/identity thief (This is the only one that I find particularly evil.)

I responded to several ads in the craigslist "apartments for rent" section. One particular flavor of response stood out.

There were a lot of autoresponses from places with great, submarket rents, and they all ask you to fill out a rental application<strong> including a lot of personal information.</strong>

<strong>Notes:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Responses were all from emails sent to listings where the original poster had used a public email address (as opposed to an anonymized craigslist address)</li>
	<li>Typical pattern is that someone lived in a gorgeous home, but had to go abroad.</li>
	<li>Abroad is typically West Africa, I have no idea why.</li>
	<li>Most of the respondents represent themselves as Christian (a reverand, a family doing missions in west africa, etc.)</li>
	<li>Tend to act as if they are aware you have the upper hand, but need to trust you (suddenly had to move away, need the money, willing to rent to you at a lower price if you're a good tenant, just prove it by emailing me your personal information). I think this is a play to disarm your suspicion.</li>
	<li>They generally display some sort of concern that they are going to be scammed themselves or a vulnerability that makes them want to qualify you as a tenant. For example, it is their personal family home, they have their furniture there and want to make sure it's in good hands in their absence.</li>
	<li>Prey on typical US perceptions of trustworthiness: Christians, ministers, reverends, families with young children</li>
</ul>
<strong>Lessons learned:</strong>
Mostly spammers post "real" addresses. Real "real" people are afraid of posting their address in the open.

<h2><strong>"Horny Young Co-Ed Wants To Chat"</strong></h2>
<strong>AKA</strong> "Men Like Nude Women"
<strong>Actual Examples:</strong> <a href="http://ezl.github.com/craigslistspam/adult.html">http://ezl.github.com/craigslistspam/adult.html</a>
<strong>Beneficiary:</strong> Actually, I don't quite get this one. I assume the site somehow generates revenue from desperate men who want to hook up with hot sexy co-eds for free! (just enter your credit card! we won't use it! trust us!)

This is pretty interesting actually.

Mike gave a girl a copy of the Redeye, a daily pop culture/sports newspaperlet in Chicago.
He later posted in Missed Connections about it, and received a garbage reply:

Not thinking about it, he responded with a short one liner and unleashed upon himself the fury that is adult website spammers.

Every day since, he has received at least 1 unsolicited emails from different girls just trying to get him to sign up for a site to connect with hot girls like her that want to chat. The really amusing thing is that (1) many of these "different" girls somehow have the same picture, and (2) the emails are almost all identical. As a teaser, these girls all send nude pics of themselves, and amazingly, sometimes their nude pics don't even look like the same girl (weird, I know).

<strong>Notes:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Tries to act like a sexy coed who is afraid YOU are a scammer of some sort. She just wants to make sure she's not chatting with a "cam girl or a bot", which is clearly the spammers play to make you think *she* isn't a "cam girl or a bot"</li>
	<li>Clearly using an automated program to vary the text of the messages, probably as an attempt to avoid email spam filters</li>
	<li>Huge corpus of alternate urls for their site.</li>
	<li>All sent from different email addresses.</li>
	<li>Whose naked photos are these?!</li>
</ul>
<h2>"Spam" is not equal to "Scam"</h2>
<div><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4079583">Callmeed on HN</a> made a point about distinguishing between "spam" and "scam".</div>
<div></div>
<div>The "Christian in West Africa Wants To Rent Lovely Home To You" category is the only one that I feel really bad about, because these people are screwing people over. The other ones are just companies doing some guerilla marketing. The "hot, horny women" category seems a little sleazy, and I don't actually know that they're NOT doing bad things with the data they collect (or what they collect), but on the surface it just seems like a spammy campaign to drive traffic.</div>
<h2>Common Characteristics in Many Craigslist Spam/Scam Messages</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Build rapport. Voice a common concern that you probably have to disqualify self as the threat.</li>
	<li>Act as an independent, concerned citizen. recommending a third party service.</li>
	<li>Respondents are female or generally prey on typical American stereotypes of honesty (Christian, African Foreign AID volunteer, social worker).</li>
	<li>Pose as vulnerable to empower the target</li>
	<li>Too good to be true</li>
</ul>
The adult site one amuses me in particular because it is the most technically involved -- clearly using spinner code, likely for spam filter evasion; probably a script that autoregisters accounts with free services, so they might also have to be beating captchas; they are sending the largest total volume of email too, so they probably have to deal sending through lots of proxies to avoid getting blacklisted by the free mail services; tons of domains involved; and at the end of it, it seems like the least likely to get conversions.

Generally I think this stuff is pretty cool. With the exception of the spammers who pretend to give you rental applications, probably as a ploy to steal your identity, I consider these mostly just interesting "grey hat" marketing tactics.

Airbnb wasn't the only one. I imagine that there are probably even 3rd party "marketing companies" that do this for your startup.  I'd be interested in hearing more about it from the inside -- if you're reading this and you know someone who might be willing to talk to me, even anonymously, please connect me.
