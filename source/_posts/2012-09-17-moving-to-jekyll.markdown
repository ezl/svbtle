Yep, I just did it.  I:

- stole the theme from Svbtle (Hey I like it, and it looks awesome -- Thanks Dustin);
- inverted the colors (not because I like it dark, but because I want my blog to look distinctive/memorable,
- threw my chop on there (Found a scan of it and its as good a logo as any, also memorable)
- imported from wordpress (still links to the original images, which will almost certainly break, and I don't care)
