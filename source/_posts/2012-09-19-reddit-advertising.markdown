Ever since I read about the success of Duck Duck Go's Reddit advertising campaign, I wanted to experiment a bit with advertising on Reddit.

I've tried a few approaches on [Google Adwords](/blog/currently-paying-150-per-conversion/ "Paying 150 Per Conversion For Rocket Lease") and [Linked](/blog/getting-started-with-linked-in-ads/ "Linked In Advertising Starter Guide") [In](/blog/linked-in-ads-results-3-days/) without a lot of success (though I'll probably try again soon, as I think I've learned a lot since early trials).

With Google, I tried the traditional keyword approach, targeting keywords that are indicative of interest in Rocket Lease's services (online rental applications).  With Linked In, the goal was to target decision makers at real estate companies who might not be actively looking for a solution but seemed like probable Rocket Lease users.

## Approach ##

With Reddit, I tried an entirely different approach.  Instead of looking for users, I wanted to appeal to Redditors to help me spread the word.  I assumed that most redditors aren't landlords but almost all redditors know someone is a landlord or rents from a landlord.

This particular appeal was a personal request for readers to share the word.  Redditors on the internet.  They probably largely prefer doing this online.  I hoped that Redditors might be willing to spread the word. I wasn't asking for signups or money or even a lot of time -- just to share the word for a process that I think they might prefer for the next time they or someone they know rents an apartment.

User time is really valuable as well, so I wanted to make it as easy as possible for users to share. The [reddit landing page](http://www.rocketlease.com/reddit/) was modeled after [500px's excellent terms of service page](http://500px.com/terms) that has the cliff notes version alongside the actual text for easy reading.  Additionally, I tried to make it easy for users to invite landlords with a built-in form and one click twitter and facebook sharing.

I advertised in the Real Estate subreddit -- I was the only advertiser in this category, so that means that my was displayed at the top of the page for any user browsing the subreddit directly and I also showed up on the main feed for any logged in users who subscribe to that subreddit.

I also spent the minimum amount advertising to the main page, which gives me exposure proportionate to the amount of money I spent ($20/day, the minimum) compared to other advertisers who were advertising on the same day.  This pool is MUCH bigger, but also generally has people who probably care less about Rocket Lease.

## Results ##

Mostly underwhelming.

Over 3 days:

+ Total cost: $150
+ 503,248 impressions
+ 398 clicks
+ 0.079% CTR
+ 6 landlord invitations
+ 1.25 pages per visit (whee, 20 % of visitors probably hit the landing page, site average is 4.5 pages/visit)
+ 89% bounce rate (substantially higher than my normal, but expected for redditors, site average is 45%)
+ average visit duration 37 seconds (eh not surprised, but I was hopeful for more, site average is 4:30 seconds/visit)

5 of the landlord invitations occured on the first day, and 1 on the second day. 'Twas cool that you can see Reddit traffic patterns in the impressions.

## What I Should Have Done Differently ##

+ __Test different headlines__  In general, I need to start split testing more things on Rocket Lease.
+ __Run the campaign for longer__ I'm conflicted on this.  On the one hand, the 3 day traffic pattern was declining and I got all my results in the first 24 hours. CTR appeared to be generally decreasing as well over time, so that makes me think users just decided they didn't care and everyone who was going to do anything did it in the first 24 hours. However, I suspect there's some value in remaining as a persistent feature on the page to really sink into readers' subconscious.  By now, its doubtful that any redditor even remembers that campaign occured at all.  For 1000 bucks, I can stay at the top of the reddit real estate section for an entire month and change the headlines over time.
