If you're working on a startup or freelancing, you often find yourself frequenting cafes around town. If you're like me, you try to stay away from Starbucks.

I've compiled a list of personal favorites and recommendations from other startup friends, grouped by approximate geographic location.

If you're funemployed like me, have other great spots I can add to the list, or want to join the Chicago Daytime Coffeeshop Circuit, or "CDCC" as I like to call it (yep, I just made that up), drop a line: ipoopdaily@rocketlease.com

## Near North ##

+ [Public Hotel](http://www.pumproom.com/) - Hotel lobby has a cafe in it with a huge work table. Work in luxurious surroundings.
+ [LM Bistro -- Hotel Felix bar](http://lmrestaurant.com/home.html) - I generally come here in the afternoons if I want to booze while I work. Great bourbon selection. Wifi: Free but spotty.
+ [Whole Foods North Ave](http://wholefoodsmarket.com/stores/lincolnpark) - Awesome. Huge work area on the second floor. Great food downstairs and a coffee bar. Also 6.00 bourbon pours and lots of great beer. Wifi: 2 hour limit, then just refresh your browser cookies; Huge plus == free parking.
+ [Panera @ Division/Sedgewick](http://www.yelp.com/biz/panera-bread-chicago-14) - Eh, it's Panera. But you can park, so I come occasionally.
+ [Starbucks Pipers Alley](http://www.yelp.com/biz/starbucks-chicago-114) - Eh, its starbucks, but its big so its easy to work with others here. Wifi its often brutal.
+ [ING Direct Cafe](http://www.yelp.com/biz/ing-direct-cafe-chicago)
+ [Cafe Des Architects](http://www.cafedesarchitectes.com/) - Sofitel hotel restaurant - dead on weekdays and they're happy to have you just sit in. Gorgeous sunlit room.
+ [Delightful Pastries](http://www.delightfulpastries.com/) - Lincoln park bakery, also dead on weekdays with nice staff. Tea isn't cheap: $4.38. Pastries are cloyingly sweet. But 4.38 to rent an office for the afternoon works for me.
+ [Elaines Coffee Call](http://www.yelp.com/biz/elaines-coffee-call-chicago) - Very cute spot in the Lincoln Hotel. Great almond milk latte.
+ [Evas](http://www.yelp.com/biz/evas-cafe-chicago-2)

## Near But Not As Near North ##

+ [Uncommon Ground](http://www.uncommonground.com/) - Only been to the Wrigleyville one. Nice big windows to let in the sun.
+ [Next Door Cafe](https://www.nextdoorchi.com/) - Lets you book conference rooms for free, great restaurants nearby, and if you're feeling adventurous, you can park at Trader Joe's next door.
+ [Floriole](http://www.floriole.com/) - Best pastries in the city. Wifi is usually good. Staff is generally nice, but J can get a little snarky if he thinks you're sitting there too long.
+ [The Bourgeois Pig](http://www.thebourgeoispigcafe.com/) - Classic spot, old two story house. Can get crowded.
+ [Citygrounds](http://www.citygroundschicago.com/) - Typically a good hideaway that stays pretty quiet, even on weekends.
+ [Bow Truss](http://bowtruss.com/) - Terrible spot to work, they're really a roaster. No idea why I'm leaving this on the list. Very sexy website though.
+ [Kickstand](http://kickstandcoffee.com/)
+ [Coffee and Tea](http://www.coffeeandtea.com/)

## Even More North ##

+ [Kopi Travelers](http://www.yelp.com/biz/kopi-travelers-cafe-chicago) - No Wifi, but i REALLY dig the atmosphere here. Get one of the spots by the window entrance its like a hippie Japanese tatami room.
+ [Coffee Studio](http://www.thecoffeestudio.com/) - Modern minimalist coffee shop with great espresso. Unforunately it often packs out.
+ [Chava](http://chavacafe.com/) - I think this place was supposed to be a Starbucks, but then corporate backed out. Chava got a great, built out spot.
+ [Book Cellar](http://www.bookcellarinc.com/cafe)
+ [Asado](http://www.asadocoffee.com/)
+ [Dollop](http://www.dollopcoffee.com/)
+ [Julius Meinl](http://www.yelp.com/biz/julius-meinl-chicago-2) - Packs out. Nice pastries

## So Far North It Might As Well Be Wisconsin ##

+ [Metropolis](http://www.metropoliscoffee.com/) - Too far away, but if you're in this hood, a good work spot.

## Near West ##

+ [Sip](http://www.yelp.com/biz/sip-coffee-house-and-garden-chicago) - Personal favorite. This is in my top 3. Cheap tea, cool staff, awesome vibe. Park on Hubbard.
+ [Swim Cafe](http://swimcafe.com/) - Big open room can get cold and loud. Good food though. Can typically find parking in front of the school next door.
+ [Big Shoulders Coffee](http://bigshoulderscoffee.com/)
+ [Lovely](http://www.lovelybakeshop.com/home.php) - Kind of a weird spot, its typically second place if swim is full.
+ [Letizia's Bakery](http://www.yelp.com/biz/letizias-natural-bakery-chicago)
+ [Jupiter Outpost](http://www.jupiteroutpost.com/)

## Old HipsterVille South (Wicker/Ukranian Village-ish) ##

+ [Atomix](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Atomix-Coffee-Shop/83455341497)
+ [Cafe Ballou](http://www.cafeballouchicago.com/)
+ [Knockbox](http://www.knockboxcafe.com/)
+ [Alliance Bakery](http://www.alliance-bakery.com/)
+ [Prasino](http://www.prasino.com/locations_chicago.html) - Don't go on weekends, you'll be stepping on their lunch service, but during the week its wide open.  A little smug, but I love the big windows.
+ [Caffe Streets](http://caffestreets.com/) - I think this place gets too loud, but my friends dig it.

## Old Hipsterville North (Bucktown) ##

+ [Wormhole](http://thewormhole.us/) - They have an old school Nintendo. That is all that matters.
+ [Filter](http://www.yelp.com/biz/filter-chicago) - Spotty. Go to Wormhole.
+ [Caffe Deluca](http://caffedeluca.com/) - Not really the best work spot, but you can camp out for 2 hours or so and get great food.
+ [Red June](http://www.redjunecafe.com/) - Great all day work spot, but not the "warmest" surroundings.
+ [Bon Bon](http://bonbonsandwiches.com/) - Eclectic decor, free wifi, great Vietnamese sandwiches. Proprieter, Tim, is a nice dude.


## South ##

+ [Artists Cafe](http://www.artists-cafe.com/) -- Conveniently near MT's house or I wouldn't ever go.
+ [Little Branch](http://www.littlebranchcafe.com/) -- Even more convenient so this is pretty much the only South Loop spot I hit.
+ [Overflow](http://www.overflowcoffeebar.org/) -- Weirdly barren.
+ [Efebina's](http://www.efebinascafe.com/) -- Decent spot if you're close to Chinatown
+ [Jumping Bean](http://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-jumping-bean-chicago) -- Not that great, but the only thing I know of near Honky Tonk BBQ.
+ [Bridgeport Coffee Company](http://www.bridgeportcoffeecompany.com/) -- Good spot, street parking, but not worth the trek for me.
