It's Christmas Eve, on a beautiful, sunny, 75 degree afternoon in Texas.

My sister is baking in the kitchen, my dad is workin on some hobby projects
around the house, and my mom is also here milling about the house.  I'm at the
kitchen table, taking a break from hacking on a little side project I started
with a new friend, AG.

Sunny and 75 degrees has a way of making it not feel quite like the Christmas
stories we're watching on the TV that's playing in our background, but really,
this is what I like about Christmas -- spending time in the company of family
and friends, with everyone doing what makes them happy.


## What I want to do is hack. ##

I like hacking. My family thinks its work, and most of my friends
do too.  But it's not.

Hacking is building. It's a hobby. Code is just the medium of digital
craftsmen. It's 2012's version of building a shelf in the
workshop, tinkering with that project car in the garage, baking to relieve
stress, etc.  It's just a electronic version.  It's no more antisocial
to stare at a screen than a table saw or under the hood of that old muscle
car. In fact, I get to talk to my family while I hack. It's fun.

If you're a nerd, code an endless supply of puzzles to solve. Nobody will call
you a workaholic for working on a puzzle in your living room, but since
most people use computers against their will at work to create TPS reports,
they don't get that this is nerd fun.

I'm not working on anything related to my "job" ([Rocket Lease, online rental applications](http://www.rocketlease.com/)),
but I'm using all the same tools. It's fun. I've timeboxed a few days off for
building an MVP so its pretty much stress-free creation.

I'm hacking on Xmas eve, its not work, and I'm loving it.  I'm not sure how
to explain to others that this is fun for me, and I'm not sure if I have to.
