One lie that I'm consantly told is *"Early stage startups only need developers"*.

It typically comes in the context of *"I don't know how to program, but I want
to work for a startup. Unfortunately, early stage startups only need coders."*

This is (a) **false**, and (b) **an excuse**.

### What Do Startups Need? ###

Startups are a quest to make valuable things from ideas and sweat.  **Early stage
startups need people who create value.**

While writing code is an easy way to feel like you're creating value, it's far from
the only way to create value.  If you can't code:

* Get customers / letters of intent
* Make cold calls
* Get lunch and coffee and dry cleaning for the developers so they can get the MVP out the door faster
* Optimize adwords campaigns
* Build buzz via social media
* Get bloggers to write about you / do PR
* Run focus groups
* Find free office space for a team by calling other startups in the area and asking if any of them will host you.

### How To Get A Job At Any Startup ###

**You can get a job at ANY early stage startup by emailing the founder and telling him you'll create value for his/her team.**  Here's a template:

<blockquote>
Hi, my name is [name].<br>

I want to work for your startup, for free. I'm not a developer. I am smart,
hardworking, motivated, and a quick learner.<br><br>

I know you may not have a budget for a non-technical team member now, so I'd
like to intern at your company for no pay for 3 weeks. During that time, I
will do anything and everything to create value for your team.<br><br>

This costs you nothing. If at any time, you can't justify keeping me around,
we will both agree to amicably part ways and I will be grateful for the
experience. No expectations.<br><br>

Could I show up on Tuesday of next week to get started? We can consider it an interview. If it seems like a fit, I'll just get
started with seeing how I can add value to the team. If I don't hear an explicit "no" from you,
I'll show see you on Tuesday!
</blockquote>

Then you have 3 weeks to make yourself absolutely indispensible to that company.

### Why This Will Work? ###

Here's a secret about startup founders: They like money. So if you can join
their team for free and make them richer, they'll be excited about paying you
to stick around. (Another hint: if they *don't* want free value creation, they
probably suck or it's not a fit anyways)

If you CAN'T make yourself unquestionably indispensible in some way, then
you need to ask yourself whether you're really adding enough value for the
startup to consider hiring you.

The next time someone tells you that code is the most important thing, consider this:

It is *sometimes* possible to outsource code. It is *never* possible to
outsource strategy or business development.
