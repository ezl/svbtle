Last year, I taught a class at [General Assembly](http://www.generalassemb.ly)
called "[How To Start A Startup If You're Not A Developer](http://www.eventbrite.com/event/3192487817)"
where I focused on helping aspiring non-technical founders
get from the idea stage to an MVP.

Since then, I've taught several variations of that course.  As a result,
I've had the privilege of connecting with many aspiring founders, both developers
and non-developers.

What follows is some unsolicited advice for first-time entrepreneurs.

### "Bad" Ideas != Failures ###

Smart people often make the jump from "I wouldn't use it" to "that won't be economically viable".

Meanwhile, that terrible restaurant down the street has been in business for 20 years and 
people continue to pay $10 (or $200 dollars) a month for Wordpress, which is open source.

There are customers other than you that will make the businesses you hate thrive.

### "Good" Ideas != Profitable Ideas ###

It's a mistake to assume that because an idea is sensible it will make money.

1. You're not "everyone other than you". You don't know how they think. What is sensible to you might not be sensible to them.
2. People rarely adopt/switch technologies for economically rational reasons alone.

### You Probably Need Less Tech Than You Think ###

Most ideas can be validated and even sold to customers before much product
development is ever done.  Try to build less.

### Getting Traction Is Harder Than You Think ###

Even if your idea is great, your product is great, and your customers love it;
expect the path to traction to be long, tedious, frustrating, and painful.

I love Dropbox. It's awesome. My friends were giving rave reviews. It made sense
to me intellectually. I installed it at least 3 times and didn't *really* start
using it for at least 12 months after I first installed it.  I still don't
pay for it.

Your product is probably less awesome than Dropbox.

Getting traction will require [steely resolve](http://startupschool.org/2012/rusenko/), lots of hard work, and more time
than you want to give (or a ton of luck).

<hr>

Most of these really boil down to this: You aren't "everyone else". It's arrogant to
presume that you can predict what millions of other people
are going to like, think, and do.
