Here are some ideas I like, but am not pursuing.

These ideas are, of course, free for the taking, if anyone reads these and cares.  I've thought about them more than the text indicates, so if anyone wants to execute, shoot me a note and I'm happy to chat further.


### Put together family plans for people (cell plans, data plans) ###

Individuals pay as much as a 50% premium for having an individual plan instead of a family plan. No cell phone carrier requires any sort of restrictions for being a "family" other than your assertion that you are a family (doesn't have to be same household, last name, or anything). You and I could be on a family plan.

Just a quick survey:

* [http://www.att.com/shop/wireless/plans/familyplans.html](http://www.att.com/shop/wireless/plans/familyplans.html) vs
* [http://www.att.com/shop/wireless/plans/individualplans.html](http://www.att.com/shop/wireless/plans/individualplans.html)

5 people is the max on a family plan. the unlimited plan divided 5 ways would be:

*  (50 * 3+119) / 5 == 270/5 == 54 bucks
*  the individual unlimited plan is 70 bucks.

Win.

*  If you were to divide up the 2100 minute plan (420 minutes each),
*  (10 * 3+110)/5 ==140/5 = 28/month
* Compare to the 450 minute individual plan for 40/mo.

Win.

Additionally realize that with any fixed, finite amount of minutes, most people don't spend all of it. Cell phone providers make a lot of money because they're effectively dealing in "overage". If I sell you 450 minutes, you'll almost certainly use some amount OTHER than 450. If you use 400 minutes, I pocket a free 50 minutes (not always, with "rollover minutes", but whatever). If you use 500 minutes, I get to charge you for 50 minutes at some obscene overate rate. bundling packages helps people save on this front as well.

There's a bit more complexity than that due to data and text plans, but you get the picture.  There are also other advantages to grouping people into family plans (for example, no contract breakage fees -- you could get on a family plan for 3 months, then bail)

this "business idea" is just a website that pairs people together to get into family plans with people they don't know.  you could be VERY involved (actually broker the transactions, take money, and have a ton of plans yourself), or decentralize it and just connect people who are looking to save money.  Either way, you create a lot of value, so you can charge the end customer a bit.


### Gym waiver forms ###

I do crossfit, which if you don't know what that is, its just another gym.  Crossfit gyms ("boxes"), dance studios, rock climbing places, karate dojos, etc all make new members sign a waiver of some sort. It's usually a crappy piece of paper that has been photocopied many times over, is hard to read, low fidelity, stored in a manila envelope in the office, and then after its signed, the gym owner files it away in a cabinet. No big deal. But they suck.

Create a simple version of the online signing interface at http://signnow.com, specialize in just dropping a signature and date field into an HTML document for gym owners and charge them $.50 a signature.  In return, they get electronic copies of their documents, you host/store all the documents for them ("in the cloud!" people love hearing that...). their docs are searchable and they can find whatever they want, whehever. They only pay for usage and its cheap. It automticaly emails copies to the owner and the new member. new members can just go to: gymwaiverform.com/mygymname on their phone to get the waiver, fill out a few html fields, drag their finger on the iphone as a signature, and boom.

the value proposition is cheap, searchable documents. always having them on hand. not having paper in your gym. email copies to you and the end consumers.

### Build your own granola bars ###

Like this site: http://www.youbars.com/buildabar/ -- create a sexy UI for building your own bar.  This site should be a ONE PAGE app. use backbone or something with a list of ingredients in a checkbox, then do quick animations to make it look like items are being poured into a mold.  Do batches of 12, ship them cheap.  These are easy to make and cost like 20 cents a granola bar at most.  It's easy to hire people to do this kind of work, shipping is easy, spoilage is minimal. Target audience == office drones who are eating unhealthy crap during the day. Get them all on a weekly subscription plan.

The game here is to connect with office managers on linked in. ask them if you can send them a free sample. tell them its better tasting and better for their employees health than the cheetos they're already buying.  close weekly subscription plans for offices.


### Connect dog walkers with dog owners ###

Tons of dog owners in cities like chicago, NYC, SF, LA pay people to walk their dogs while they're at work. Create the 2 sided market for this service exclusively. build in reviews and rating systems for both sides (a la Uber).

This may sound ridiculous, but this market is surprisingly bigger than you'd think (I have seen a dog walking companies financials and I was flabbergasted). Charge 5 bucks to connect a pair. Or have them book and pay through the site and charge $1 per walk (dogs are getting walked every day...).  Dog owners will probably like the convenience of online payment instead of always running to bank of america to get cash for their walker.  also, if their walker is unavailable, they'll be able to find another local walker that is well-reviewed.

This idea sort of exists. But nobody has traction. If dog owners/walkers don't know about it, then it effectively doesn't exist for them

### Booze delivery ###

If you've ever been drunk and out of vodka, would you have paid a 5 dollar premium to have it delivered to your door in 30 minutes? Someone will.

Booze is cheap for liquor stores. If you can help them move product, someone will offer you a commission (call it an advertising fee, selling liquor requires abiding by laws, advertising doesn;t).

Drunk people pay a premium for delivery.

so that $25 bottle at the store, could be a $10 fee for the delivery business (5 from the store, 5 from the consumer).

the tech is minimal. a really clean and simple UI for picking between 4-5 choices (absolut, $15; grey goose $35; jack daniels $25, patron, $30; case of budweiser $20), an html form to take in name, address, and an image of your photo id, and a embedded stripe form for processing payments.

at the early stage, this just fires an email to the CEO.

The CEO's job is to promote this website, get people buying, manage bike messengers/drivers to deliver the product.

After he's delivered 100 orders, then talk about automation and scaling.


### CSS Bounties.com ###

I suck at CSS. Lots of people are good at it.

Often, in 10 minutes, someone can solve the sort of problem that could take me 6 hours to solve.

Put bounties on CSS problems for immediate solving. Inspired by [this reddit thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/17ne2z/hiring_20_to_whomever_tells_me_how_to_fix_this_css/).

Let the internet solve your CSS problems, collaborate with the folks in #css on freenode.

The person with the problem posts a description, URL to the site, and the desired outcome on the site and an expiration date.  They paypal the site with the bounty (minimum $5).  They can cancel the bounty at any time before a solution is posted.

If the expiration date hits without a solution, it is returned to the poster.

People can post solutions to problems, if theirs is selected, the bounty is released to that person.
