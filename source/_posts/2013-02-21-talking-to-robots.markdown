I unfairly get angry at the customer service representative whenever I have to enter information into the automated system and then the first thing the customer service rep does is ask me for the same information.

It's really not the customer service rep's fault.  They're just hourly wage workers and it's really bank of america/verizon/tmobile/some shitty company's fault that they don't transfer the information they request.

It still irks me though and even though i know it's not the fault of the person on the other end of the phone, my patience is always a little shorter.

Big companies: if you ask me for information, will you please just fucking transfer that information to the representative?
